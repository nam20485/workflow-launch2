Listed beklow are all of the active dynamic workflows and their paths.

Agents MUST resolve dynamic workflows from the remote canonical repository. Do not use local mirrors.

Single Source of Truth

- The dynamic workflow files listed below in the `nam20485/agent-instructions` repository are the only authoritative source for dynamic workflow scripts.
- Do not reference local golden files, cached plans, or any mirrored copies; they are non-authoritative and should be removed if found.
- Any edits made upstream to these files must be reflected immediately in subsequent runs by always dereferencing the remote raw URLs at runtime.
