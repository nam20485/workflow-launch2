# **Website Optimization Plan: Rebranding for R\&D & Innovation**

Target Audience: Federal Grant Reviewers (NSF/DOD), Research Partners, Enterprise Innovation Leads.  
Current Status: "Software Dev & Consulting Shop."  
Goal Status: "Advanced R\&D Lab & Specialized Engineering Partner."

## **1\. High-Level Strategy: The "Practitioner-Researcher"**

We are not abandoning consulting. We are framing it as our "Laboratory."

* *Old Message:* "We build apps for you."  
* *New Message:* "We research SOTA cognitive architectures and deploy them in mission-critical environments."

## **2\. Structural & Content Changes**

### **A. The Homepage (The "Hook")**

* **Hero Section:**  
  * **Headline:** "Engineering the Next Generation of Autonomous Intelligence."  
  * **Sub-headline:** "Bridging the gap between academic theory and enterprise reality. We build secure, stateful, and audit-ready AI systems for high-compliance sectors."  
  * **Primary CTA:** "Explore Our Research" (Links to new Research page).  
  * **Secondary CTA:** "Consulting Services" (Links to existing services).  
* **Trust Bar:** Add logos of technologies you master (Neo4j, .NET Aspire, Python, Azure, AWS) mixed with "Research Focus" icons (Agentic Workflows, GraphRAG).

### **B. New Page: "Research & Innovation" (The "Proof")**

* **Concept:** This page proves you are eligible for SBIR grants. It shows you are doing *science*, not just engineering.  
* **Content Sections:**  
  1. **The Mission:** "Solving the 'Amnesia' and 'Hallucination' problems in Large Language Models."  
  2. **Core Initiatives:**  
     * *Dynamic Hierarchical Memory:* Moving beyond static R\&D to living knowledge graphs.  
     * *Entropy-Based Curation:* Algorithmic approaches to data integrity in long-running agents.  
     * *Deterministic Verification:* Safety layers for stochastic systems.  
  3. **Collaborate:** "We partner with academic institutions and federal agencies to de-risk deep tech."

### **C. Services Page (Refined)**

* **Retain:** Custom Software Development, Cloud Architecture.  
* **Rename:** Change "IT Consulting" to **"Advanced Technology Strategy."**  
* **Add:** **"Prototype Engineering"** – "We turn bleeding-edge papers into production-ready code." (This explains *why* a research firm does consulting).

## **3\. UI/UX & Design Overhaul (The "Professional" Look)**

### **The Problem: "Too Busy / Trying Too Hard"**

* Current site likely has too many animations, stock photos of "futuristic nodes," or dense text blocks. This signals "junior agency."

### **The Fix: "The Lab Aesthetic"**

* **Visual Style:** Clean, minimalist, confident. Think "Palantir" or "OpenAI," not "Wix Template."  
* **Color Palette:**  
  * *Primary:* Deep Charcoal or Midnight Blue (Trust/Security).  
  * *Accent:* Electric Teal or Cyan (Innovation/AI) – use sparingly for buttons/links only.  
  * *Background:* Off-white or very light gray (readability). Avoid pure black backgrounds unless it's a specific "Dark Mode" aesthetic.  
* **Typography:** Use a high-readability Sans-Serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Helvetica Neue). Increase line height (white space) to make text breathe.  
* **Imagery:**  
  * *Remove:* Generic stock photos of "people shaking hands" or "glowing brains."  
  * *Replace with:* Abstract, geometric patterns (representing graphs/networks) or high-quality architectural diagrams (like the ones in your report).

### **4\. Implementation Checklist for Admin**

1. \[ \] **Simplify Navigation:** Limit top menu to: *Home | Research | Services | About | Contact*.  
2. \[ \] **De-Clutter Homepage:** Remove "Feature bloat." Focus on 3 core value props: *Research, Engineering, Security.*  
3. \[ \] **Add "Research" Page:** Create the new page using the text provided in the "Manifesto" document.  
4. \[ \] **Update Footer:** Add "Based in Bothell, WA" (Locality helps with local networking).
