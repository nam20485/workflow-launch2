Okay, here is a high-level implementation plan for the described free, open-source Windows desktop application, structured according to the requested phases and using Markdown.


High-Level Implementation Plan: Local AI Technical Support App


This document outlines a phased approach for developing a free, open-source Windows desktop application leveraging a local SLM and RAG for technical support based on a user-provided knowledge base.

Core Strategy Recap: On-Device SLM (e.g., Phi-3), RAG Architecture, ONNX Runtime + DirectML for acceleration, C# + Avalonia UI.

---

1. Phase 1: Core Setup & Knowledge Base Preparation


This phase focuses on establishing the foundational development environment and the pipeline for processing the local knowledge base into a format suitable for RAG.

Objectives:

Set up the C# Avalonia project structure.


Integrate ONNX Runtime and DirectML provider.


Define and implement the knowledge base ingestion and processing pipeline (parsing, chunking, embedding).


Select and integrate a local vector storage mechanism.


Key Tasks:

1.1 Project Initialization:


Create a new C# project using the Avalonia UI framework template.


Establish basic project structure (e.g., separate projects for UI, Core Logic, Data Processing).


Set up source control (Git) and hosting (e.g., GitHub).


1.2 ONNX Runtime Integration:


Add necessary ONNX Runtime and DirectML NuGet packages to the Core Logic project.


Develop basic code to initialize the ONNX environment and verify DirectML provider availability.


1.3 Knowledge Base Ingestion & Processing:


Define supported knowledge base formats (e.g., plain text files, Markdown, potentially simple HTML).


Implement parsers for chosen formats.


Develop a robust text chunking strategy (e.g., fixed size with overlap) suitable for RAG.

Select and integrate a local embedding model (must be ONNX compatible, potentially quantized for size/speed). Note: An embedding model is needed for both KB processing and user query processing in RAG.

Implement the process to load KB files, chunk them, and generate embeddings for each chunk using the chosen embedding model via ONNX Runtime.


1.4 Local Vector Storage:


Evaluate options for local vector storage (e.g., Faiss bindings, custom simple file format, SQLite extension).


Implement the storage mechanism to save the chunk embeddings and associated original text/metadata (e.g., source file, chunk index).


Develop functions for loading the vector store and performing basic similarity searches (vector search).


1.5 Basic KB Management CLI (Optional but Recommended):


Create a simple command-line interface tool for ingesting and updating the knowledge base locally, separate from the main UI application for easier testing.


Deliverables:

Initialized Avalonia project with source control.


Code demonstrating ONNX Runtime and DirectML initialization.


Working pipeline for loading, chunking, embedding, and storing knowledge base content locally.


Proof-of-concept local vector search implementation.

2. Phase 2: AI Service & RAG Implementation


This phase builds upon the processed knowledge base to implement the core RAG logic, integrating the SLM for generating responses.

Objectives:

Integrate the selected SLM (e.g., Phi-3 ONNX model).


Implement the full RAG pipeline flow (query embedding, vector search, context retrieval, prompt construction, SLM inference).


Optimize model loading and inference execution.


Key Tasks:

2.1 SLM Integration:


Develop code to load the ONNX-formatted SLM model using ONNX Runtime and the DirectML provider.


Handle potential model quantization and different model sizes.


2.2 Query Processing:


Implement a function to take a user query (text).


Use the same embedding model from Phase 1 (or a dedicated query embedding model) to generate an embedding vector for the user query.


2.3 Context Retrieval:


Perform a similarity search in the local vector store using the query embedding to find the top-k most relevant knowledge base chunks.


Retrieve the original text content of these relevant chunks.


2.4 RAG Prompt Construction:


Design an effective prompt template that includes clear instructions for the SLM, the user query, and the retrieved context chunks.


Implement the function to construct the final prompt string.


2.5 SLM Inference:


Send the constructed RAG prompt to the loaded SLM model via ONNX Runtime.


Implement code to handle the model's output (potentially streaming tokens for a responsive UI).


2.6 RAG Pipeline Orchestration:


Create a RAGService or similar class that encapsulates the entire flow: (Query -> Embed -> Search -> Retrieve -> Prompt -> Generate -> Return Answer).


Implement error handling within the RAG pipeline (e.g., no relevant chunks found, inference error).


Deliverables:

Code to load and run inference on the SLM via ONNX/DirectML.


Working RAG pipeline implementation that accepts a query and returns a generated answer based on the local KB.


Initial performance benchmarks for loading and inference.

3. Phase 3: UI/UX & Application Integration


This phase focuses on building the user interface and connecting it to the RAG backend, making the application usable.

Objectives:

Design and implement the main application UI using Avalonia.


Integrate the RAG Service into the UI flow.


Implement settings and configuration management.


Prepare for application packaging and distribution.


Key Tasks:

3.1 Main Application UI Design:


Design the main window layout: Input area for queries, output area for responses, possibly a status bar.


Consider UI elements for showing search progress or model loading status.


3.2 UI Implementation (Avalonia):


Implement the UI design using Avalonia XAML and C# code-behind or ViewModel pattern (MVVM).


Set up data binding between the UI elements and application logic.


3.3 Integrating RAG with UI:


Wire up the user input (text box, submit button) to trigger calls to the RAGService.


Display the generated response in the output area.


Implement responsive feedback while the RAG pipeline is running (e.g., loading spinner, "Thinking..." message).


Handle and display errors gracefully in the UI.


3.4 Configuration & Settings:


Implement UI elements for configuring application settings:


Path to the knowledge base folder/files.


Path to the SLM model file.


Path to the embedding model file.


ONNX/DirectML settings (e.g., preferred device).


Implement logic to save and load these settings (e.g., using application settings or a config file).


Add functionality to trigger the knowledge base ingestion process (Phase 1) from the UI based on the configured path.


3.5 User Experience Enhancements:


Format the output text for readability.


Potentially highlight which KB chunks were used (citing sources).


3.6 Packaging and Distribution Preparation:


Configure the project for building a distributable package for Windows (e.g., self-contained executable, MSIX package, Inno Setup script).


Identify runtime dependencies (like VC++ redistributables if needed by ONNX) and plan how to bundle/manage them.


Deliverables:

Functional desktop application UI allowing users to input queries and receive responses from the RAG system.


Settings management UI and logic.


Mechanism to trigger KB processing from the UI.


Initial application build/package for testing.

4. Phase 4: Tooling & Agentic Capabilities


This phase explores extending the application beyond simple Q&A to enable the SLM to potentially perform actions based on user requests, integrating "tools" or "agents". This is a forward-looking phase for future versions.

Objectives:

Design a framework for defining and executing discrete actions ("tools").


Integrate tool usage into the RAG/Inference pipeline.


Implement initial example tools relevant to technical support.


Key Tasks:

4.1 Tooling Framework Design:


Define an interface or base class for tools (e.g., ITool with Name, Description, Parameters, Execute methods).


Develop a mechanism for the application to discover and register available tools.


Design a secure way for tools to interact with the system (e.g., restricted access, user prompts).


4.2 Integrating Tools with SLM:


Modify the RAG prompt or use a separate prompt to instruct the SLM on how to identify user intent requiring a tool and how to format a "tool call" in its output (e.g., using a specific JSON format or token sequence).


Implement an "Agent Orchestrator" or parser that analyzes the SLM's output.


If a tool call is detected, parse the tool name and parameters.


Validate the tool call against the registered tools and parameters.


Implement a mechanism to execute the requested tool.


4.3 Tool Execution and Response:


Execute the tool's action.


Capture the tool's result (success/failure, output data).


Optionally, feed the tool's result back into the SLM as context for a follow-up inference step to generate a final user-friendly response explaining the action taken and its outcome (ReAct pattern).


4.4 Implementing Example Tools:


Develop basic, low-risk example tools:


SearchWeb: (Requires internet access - maybe defer or make optional)


ReadFile: Read content of a specified local file (with path restrictions/permissions).


ListDirectory: List files in a specified directory (with path restrictions).


PingHost: Ping a network host.

Future/Higher Risk Tools (requires significant security consideration):
ModifyConfigFile, ReadRegistryKey, WriteRegistryKey, ExecuteCommand.


4.5 Security and User Confirmation:


Implement mandatory user confirmation prompts before executing any tool that modifies the system or accesses sensitive data.


Carefully design the security context under which tools run to minimize potential harm.


Deliverables:

Framework for defining and executing tools.


Integration logic allowing the SLM to invoke tools based on prompt analysis.


Implementation of several basic, safe example tools.


Design considerations and initial implementation for user confirmation and security around tool execution.

5. Key Risks & Mitigations


Developing an on-device AI application involves unique challenges. Identifying risks early is crucial.

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Performance on diverse hardware | SLM inference and embedding generation can be slow on older/lower-end hardware, even with DirectML. | Optimize ONNX configuration; Offer different model sizes (smaller for lower-end); Provide performance settings; Fallback gracefully to CPU if DirectML fails/is slow; Clearly state minimum requirements. |
| ONNX Runtime / DirectML setup complexities| Users might lack required drivers, runtimes (e.g., VC++), or compatible GPUs; Setup can be fragile. | Bundle necessary redistributables in the installer; Provide clear installation instructions and troubleshooting guides; Implement robust error detection and user-friendly messages for setup issues. |
| SLM / Embedding Model size & distribution | Models can be large files, making initial download/distribution challenging. | Host models for download; Provide a simple in-app downloader; Explain required disk space; Consider offering quantized versions to reduce size. |
| Knowledge Base quality and format issues | RAG performance is highly dependent on the quality, format, and relevance of the source data; parsing issues. | Provide clear guidelines/documentation on preparing the knowledge base; Implement basic validation checks during ingestion; Support common, simple formats first. |
| RAG Effectiveness | Poor chunking, embedding model choice, or prompt engineering can lead to irrelevant context or poor answers. | Make chunking strategy configurable (advanced setting); Allow users to potentially swap embedding models (future); Continuously refine prompt templates; Enable feedback mechanisms. |
| Agentic Feature Security (Phase 4) | Tools that modify the system (registry, files) pose significant security risks if misused or compromised. | Strictly require user confirmation for ALL modification actions; Define and enforce granular permissions for tools; Isolate tool execution process if possible; Start with read-only or low-impact tools. |
| Open Source Contribution & Maintenance | Lack of contributors, difficulty managing contributions, long-term maintenance burden. | Establish clear coding standards and documentation; Use standard tooling (issue trackers, PR reviews); Foster a welcoming community; Start small and iterate. |
| Dependency Management | Keeping track of Avalonia, ONNX, and other library updates and potential breaking changes. | Use dependency management tools (NuGet); Regularly update dependencies and test compatibility; Pin major versions initially. |
