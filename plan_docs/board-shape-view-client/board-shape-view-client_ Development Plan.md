# **board-shape-view-client: Development Plan**

This document provides a comprehensive, multi-phase development plan for the board-shape-view-client application. It incorporates the architectural decisions, outlines the core technologies, and defines user stories for key features, with a primary focus on delivering a functional MVP in the first phase.

## **1\. Motivation & Guiding Principles**

The core purpose of this project is to create a lightweight, web-based client that can visualize complex Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs from ODB++ data. The target audience is PCB designers and engineers who need a quick, accessible way to view and inspect board layouts without requiring heavy-duty CAD software. Success is a fast, responsive viewer that can render a board from a remote data source and provide basic interactive controls.

The project is guided by these core principles:

* **Speed to MVP**: The highest priority is to develop a working prototype that demonstrates the core functionality: fetching data, rendering shapes, and basic 3D navigation. Later phases will build upon this solid foundation.  
* **Modularity**: The system must be composed of independent components (API handling, state management, rendering, UI). This enhances testability, allows for parallel development, and simplifies future upgrades.  
* **Performance**: The application must remain fluid and responsive, even with complex boards. This involves making smart choices about rendering techniques and handling data processing efficiently to prevent UI freezing.

## **2\. Architectural Decisions**

To achieve our goals of speed, accessibility, and performance, we have chosen to build the application as a modern, browser-based Single Page Application (SPA). This approach allows for rapid development and deployment, and leverages powerful web-native 3D rendering libraries.

We evaluated several options before arriving at our chosen architecture:

* **Alternative Option (Desktop Application)**: A native desktop application was considered. It was rejected due to the significantly higher complexity in cross-platform development (Windows, macOS, Linux) and the overhead of installation for the end-user. A web application provides instant access and is platform-agnostic.  
* **Chosen Approach (Web Application)**: This approach was selected for its **rapid prototyping**, **zero-installation user experience**, and access to a mature ecosystem of web technologies. The primary challenge of this approach—rendering performance with very large datasets in the browser—will be mitigated by using an efficient rendering library (Three.js) and deferring complex feature implementation (like level-of-detail and culling) to post-MVP phases.

## **3\. Core Technologies**

* **Language**: **TypeScript**  
  * **Rationale**: TypeScript provides strong typing for the complex ODB++ data structures, which will significantly reduce runtime errors and improve developer productivity.  
* **Framework**: **React**  
  * **Rationale**: React has a vast ecosystem, excellent state management solutions, and a component-based architecture that is a natural fit for this application's modular design.  
* **UI Framework**: **Tailwind CSS**  
  * **Rationale**: A utility-first CSS framework that will allow for rapid styling of UI components like toolbars and panels without writing custom CSS.  
* **3D Rendering Library**: **Three.js** (via react-three-fiber)  
  * **Rationale**: Three.js is the de-facto standard for web-based 3D graphics, offering immense flexibility and a large community. The react-three-fiber library provides a declarative, component-based syntax for Three.js that integrates perfectly with React.  
* **Build Tool**: **Vite**  
  * **Rationale**: Vite offers a near-instant development server startup and lightning-fast hot module replacement, dramatically speeding up the development feedback loop.  
* **API Client**: **Axios**  
  * **Rationale**: A mature, promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making requests to the OdbDesignServer REST API and handling responses.  
* **State Management**: **Zustand**  
  * **Rationale**: A lightweight, unopinionated state management library for React that is simpler to set up and use than Redux, making it ideal for managing application state like layer visibility and selected features for an MVP.  
* **CI/CD**: **GitHub Actions**  
  * **Rationale**: For automating the build and deployment process directly from the source code repository.

## **4\. Phased Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & MVP 2.5D Viewer (Objective: A working demo)**

The goal of this phase is to build the absolute core of the application: fetching data from the server and rendering it in an interactive viewport.

* **Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding**  
  * Initialize the Git repository.  
  * Set up a new React \+ TypeScript project using Vite.  
  * Install core dependencies: three, react-three-fiber, axios, zustand, tailwindcss.  
* **Task 1.2: API & Data Modeling**  
  * Create a simple API client service with Axios to communicate with the OdbDesignServer.  
  * Define TypeScript interfaces for the key ODB++ data structures based on the server's JSON output.  
* **Task 1.3: Basic 2.5D Viewport**  
  * Set up a react-three-fiber canvas.  
  * Implement an orthographic camera with a slight tilt to give a sense of depth (2.5D).  
  * Add basic camera controls (OrbitControls) for pan, zoom, and rotation.  
* **Task 1.4: Shape Rendering Engine (MVP)**  
  * Create a "Shape Factory" component that takes the fetched ODB++ JSON data as input.  
  * Implement rendering for a limited set of essential shapes (e.g., pads and lines) to prove the pipeline. Complex shapes like custom polygons will be deferred.  
* **Deliverables**:  
  * A web page that loads.  
  * On load, it fetches a hardcoded board design from the server.  
  * The board's pads and lines are rendered in a 3D space.  
  * The user can pan, zoom, and rotate the camera to view the board.

### **Phase 2: Core Features & UI**

* **Objective**: To enhance the viewer with layer management and a more robust shape rendering capability.  
* **Tasks**:  
  * Implement rendering for all remaining ODB++ feature types (surfaces, arcs, text).  
  * Create a layer panel UI to display all board layers.  
  * Implement state management (Zustand) to toggle the visibility of each layer.  
  * Add a simple toolbar with controls like "Zoom to Fit".

### **Phase 3: Interaction & Polish**

* **Objective**: To allow users to interact with the board features and improve the user experience.  
* **Tasks**:  
  * Implement feature selection (raycasting) to allow users to click on individual shapes.  
  * Create an inspector panel that displays properties of the selected feature.  
  * Add loading indicators and handle API errors gracefully.  
  * Optimize rendering performance for larger boards.

## **5\. User Stories**

### **Epic: Core Board Visualization (MVP)**

* **As a PCB designer**, I want to load the application and see a board's design rendered automatically, **so that** I can instantly verify that the data connection and rendering pipeline are working.  
* **As a user**, I want to use my mouse to pan (drag), zoom (scroll), and rotate the view of the PCB, **so that** I can inspect it from different angles and magnifications.  
* **As a developer**, I want the application to fetch board data from the OdbDesignServer REST API, **so that** I can display real, externally-managed PCB designs.  
* **As a user**, I want to see the basic pads and lines of a board layer rendered in the viewport, **so that** I can understand the fundamental layout of the circuit.

### **Epic: Layer Management**

* **As a PCB designer**, I want to see a list of all layers present in the design, **so that** I know what parts of the board I can inspect.  
* **As a PCB designer**, I want to click a checkbox or button to toggle the visibility of individual layers, **so that** I can isolate specific parts of the design and reduce visual clutter.

## **6\. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Performance Bottleneck** | Rendering very large boards with tens of thousands of features could freeze the browser or result in a low frame rate. | **MVP**: Accept performance limitations for very large boards. **Post-MVP**: Implement performance optimizations like instanced rendering for repeated shapes and geometry culling for off-screen elements. |
| **Server API Unavailability** | The OdbDesignServer may be down or unreachable, preventing the client from fetching board data. | Implement a robust API client that handles HTTP errors gracefully. Display a clear, user-friendly error message in the UI and provide a "Retry" button. |
| **Complex Shape Rendering** | ODB++ supports complex polygon surfaces with holes, which can be challenging to triangulate and render correctly in Three.js. | **MVP**: Defer rendering of complex surfaces. Focus on simpler primitives like pads and lines first. **Post-MVP**: Investigate and implement a robust polygon triangulation library compatible with Three.js. |
| **Scope Creep** | Adding unplanned features during the MVP phase could delay the delivery of the core working prototype. | Adhere strictly to the phased development plan. All new feature requests must be documented and prioritized for a future phase, not added to the current development sprint. |
