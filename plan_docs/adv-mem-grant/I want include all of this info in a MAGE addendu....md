# **Networking Outreach Plan: Bothell/Seattle Ecosystem**

**Goal:** Secure 1-2 strategic advisors and a compliance review partner before the NSF SBIR submission.

## **1\. Priority Outreach Targets**

### **A. Washington APEX Accelerator (Compliance)**

* **Mission:** Help with government contracting/SBIR.  
* **Action:** Register as a client (free) and request a meeting to discuss "SBIR Phase I Proposal Prep."  
* **Email Script (if needed):Subject:** New Client Inquiry: NSF SBIR Phase I Assistance (Bothell-based AI Startup)  
  Hello,  
  I am the founder of a Bothell-based AI software company currently preparing an NSF SBIR Phase I Project Pitch. I am writing to request an advising session to ensure my entity registrations (SAM.gov) and proposal strategy align with federal requirements.  
  I am a veteran technologist with extensive industry experience, currently enrolled in the UW Cyber Security graduate program. I would value your guidance on navigating the compliance landscape.  
  Best regards,  
  \[Your Name\]

### **B. UW CoMotion (Academic/IP)**

* **Mission:** Innovation transfer and student support.  
* **Action:** Visit the CoMotion website and look for "Office Hours" or "Mentoring."  
* **Email Script (for a specific mentor or general inquiry):Subject:** UW Grad Student / Founder seeking SBIR guidance  
  Hi \[Name\],  
  I am a current graduate student in the Cyber Security program and the founder of an AI memory startup. I am preparing an NSF SBIR application focused on "Entropy-based Memory Curation" for Large Language Models.  
  Given my dual status as a student and founder, I would appreciate a brief conversation about how to best leverage the UW ecosystem without violating IP policies. Do you have any open office hours coming up?  
  Best,  
  \[Your Name\]

### **C. Startup425 (Local Ecosystem)**

* **Mission:** Eastside business growth.  
* **Action:** Join their mailing list and look for the next "Foundations" mixer or mentor matchmaking event.

## **2\. Strategic "Ask" for Advisors**

When you meet someone senior (e.g., a professor or retired tech exec), your goal is to get them to agree to be a **"Senior Advisor"** on your grant.

* **The Pitch:** "I don't need you to do the work. I need you to be the 'Adult in the Room' who keeps us honest on the \[Math/Science/Strategy\]. Would you be willing to sign a Letter of Support stating you will advise us for 2 hours a month?"  
* **The Value:** This costs them nothing but adds massive credibility to your "Team" score.

## **3\. Weekly Networking Metrics**

* **Week 1:** Register with APEX Accelerator. Send 3 emails to potential UW advisors (professors in AI/Security).  
* **Week 2:** Attend one local event (Startup425 or CoMotion).  
* **Week 3:** Secure one Letter of Support or verbal commitment for the grant.
