**Headline:** Beyond Stateless AI: Architecting Long-Horizon Autonomy

Introduction  
Current Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from "catastrophic forgetting" and "contextual drift." For a chatbot, these are annoyances. For critical infrastructure in Defense, Finance, or Healthcare, they are disqualifying failures.  
We are an R\&D-first firm dedicated to solving these specific architectural challenges.

**Our Focus Areas**

* **The Living Knowledge Graph:** Moving beyond static vector databases to dynamic graphs that update in real-time without expensive re-indexing.  
* **Entropy-Based Curation:** Developing autonomous algorithms that detect and prune "hallucinated" memories before they corrupt the system's truth source.  
* **Deterministic Verification:** Building "Grounding Layers" that force stochastic models to validate their outputs against trusted specifications.

Collaboration  
We actively seek partnerships with academic researchers and government programs to mitigate technical uncertainty and mature these technologies.
