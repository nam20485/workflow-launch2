Based on the detailed development plan for the **Interaction Intelligence Platform v1.0**, here is a breakdown of its completion status:

### **Overall Completion: Approximately 33%**

The foundational work and the first major phase of development are fully specified. The subsequent phases, while outlined, still require the same level of in-depth expansion.

---

### **Finished Sections**

The following sections are complete and provide enough detail for an implementation team to begin work:

* **Section 1: Vision & Application Philosophy:** The project's guiding principles are fully articulated.  
* **Section 2: Application Layout & Architecture:** The high-level architecture, technology stack, and integration strategies are clearly defined and finalized.  
* **Section 3, Phase 1: Core Local Experience & Trust Foundation:** This is the most complete part of the feature specification. All features (F-101 through F-107) have been expanded with detailed descriptions, user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical notes.

### **Sections Not Yet Finished**

These sections have been outlined with high-level feature descriptions but still need to be expanded into the detailed format used for Phase 1:

* **Section 3, Phase 2: From Insight to Action â€” Advanced Analytics & Interactive Tooling:** Features F-201 through F-206 are defined but require the full breakdown.  
* **Section 3, Phase 3: Workflow Integration & Extensibility:** Features F-301 through F-304 are also at a high-level stage and need further specification.  
* **Section 4: Requirements:** While the non-functional requirements, testing strategy, and distribution plan are listed, they could be expanded with more specific metrics and details as the project progresses.
