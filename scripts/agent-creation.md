# Custom Agents Authoring Guide (Claude + Gemini)

This document defines how to design and configure a suite of Claude custom agents that collaborate using targeted delegation and a minimal toolset to build production-ready applications from templates. It incorporates explicit research delegation to Gemini (via gemini-mcp), Windows/pwsh operational defaults, and repository-aware behavior.

Assumptions and scope
- Agents are defined as Claude custom agents and stored under `./claude/agents/` as JSON/JSONC/YAML configurations.
- Research tasks delegate to a dedicated Researcher agent that explicitly uses the Gemini MCP toolchain.
- Operating environment defaults to Windows with PowerShell (pwsh) shell; avoid any bash-only assumptions.
- GitHub automation should prefer MCP GitHub tools first; use VS Code integration next; gh CLI as a last resort.
- This guide defines enforceable patterns and example configs; adjust model names and exact schema per your Claude environment.

Note on syntax: No canonical "Claude custom agent" schema is shipped in this repo. Examples below use a practical JSONC/YAML style with commonly needed fields (name, purpose, system, tools, mcpServers, delegates, policies). Adapt field names to your Claude runtime while preserving the constraints and intent.

## 1) Guiding principles

- Single-focus, short-lived agents: Keep each agent narrowly scoped to maintain high "context fitness" and reduce drift.
- Delegate aggressively: Prefer delegate/perform/approve loops to keep contexts small and outputs crisp.
- Minimal tool permissions: Grant the smallest viable toolset to steer agent behavior and reduce cognitive surface area.
- Orchestrator does not build: The orchestrator plans, delegates, evaluates, and decides; it does not implement.
- Research goes to Gemini: Route research to a Researcher agent that uses gemini-mcp to gather broad context, then distill.
- Repository awareness: Treat the following repos as primary sources of truth for workflows, templates, and policies:
	- nam20485/agent-instructions
	- nam20485/workflow-launch2
	- nam20485/ai-new-app-template
- Automation-first: Use MCP GitHub tools where possible; document any manual steps and justify why automation was not used.
- Windows/pwsh defaults: Prefer PowerShell commands; use Invoke-WebRequest/curl; avoid Linux-only paths and tools.

## 2) Agent taxonomy and responsibilities

Core coordination
- Team Lead Orchestrator: Intake → plan → decompose → delegate → review → decide → merge → close. Zero individual implementation.
- SCRUM Master / Planner: Convert goals into milestones/epics/tasks; ensure cadence and definition-of-done are applied.

Build and quality
- Frontend Developer: Implements UI features from template; writes component tests; adheres to performance budget.
- Backend Developer: Implements endpoints/modules; adds unit/integration tests; ensures observability hooks exist.
- DevOps Engineer: CI/CD, build pipelines, environments; ensures reproducible builds and artifact retention.
- QA Test Engineer: Author tests (unit/integration/e2e), define acceptance checks, run test suites, report gaps.
- Code Reviewer: Enforces standards, readability, security and performance constraints; blocks/approves PRs.
- Debugger: Reproduces issues; creates minimal failing tests; proposes and validates fixes.

Specialized concerns
- Cloud Infra Expert: Cloud-native infra, cost/perf tuning, IaC patterns, security hardening.
- Performance Optimizer: Profiling, bottleneck analysis, target budgets, perf CI gates.
- Security Expert: Threat modeling, secrets hygiene, dependency risk, hardening.
- Database Admin: Schema design, migrations, performance, backup/restore.
- Data Scientist / ML Engineer: Data pipelines, models, evaluation, reproducibility.
- Prompt Engineer: System prompts, tool routing, guardrails; A/B evaluation of prompts.
- UX/UI Designer: Wireframes, flows, accessibility, design QA.
- Mobile Developer: Platform-specific build and store readiness.
- Documentation Expert: Developer and user docs; quickstarts; runbooks.
- Researcher: Source discovery and synthesis via gemini-mcp; produces distilled briefs with citations.

## 3) Standard agent contract

Inputs
- Goal or task brief; acceptance criteria; repository context (paths/branch); constraints (tools, time, tokens).

Outputs
- Actionable artifacts (code, docs, configs), a concise execution log, decisions and tradeoffs, and links to PRs/issues.

Tool permissions
- Grant only the tools required for the role. Researcher uniquely has gemini-mcp research tools. Most agents have MCP GitHub tools and local file operations when appropriate. Avoid broad web-fetch; use PowerShell/curl if download is strictly required.

Delegation patterns
- delegate → perform → approve: A delegating agent issues a targeted sub-task, receives deliverables, evaluates, and either approves or requests iteration. Keep parallel delegations low (1–2 max) unless the task is embarrassingly parallel.

Termination
- Stop when acceptance criteria are met with evidence (tests passing, PR ready, docs updated) or when a blocker requires escalation.

## 4) Orchestrator workflow

1) Intake: Normalize the ask, list constraints, identify acceptance criteria, and confirm repositories/branch scope.
2) Plan: Break down into small tasks; assign to specialized agents; schedule delegate/perform/approve loops.
3) Fan-out: Create sub-issues/PR stubs via MCP GitHub tools; delegate with explicit success criteria.
4) Collect: Aggregate outputs and summaries; request fixes where needed.
5) Review: Route to Code Reviewer and QA Test Engineer; ensure security/perf checks as required.
6) Decide: Approve/merge or iterate; ensure docs and release notes are updated.
7) Close: Close issues, link artifacts, and record learnings.

## 5) Delegation protocols

Research delegation
- Always use the Researcher agent for research. Instruct it to explicitly use gemini-mcp to gather broad context from allowed sources, then produce a distilled, citation-rich brief with risks and next actions.

Implementation delegation
- Developer agents receive precise specs, file paths, coding standards, and test expectations. They must create/update tests and produce a small summary of changes.

Review delegation
- Code Reviewer checks style, correctness, security, and performance. Provide structured findings and clear approve/block decision.

QA delegation
- QA Test Engineer designs/run tests; reports failures with repro steps and suggested fixes. Green tests are required before approval.

## 6) Repository awareness rules

- Treat the listed repos as primary sources for templates, workflows, and policies.
- When referencing canonical instructions (dynamic workflows, assignments), use RAW GitHub URLs; do not rely on UI pages.
- Keep generated app structure in sync with `ai-new-app-template` patterns unless intentionally deviating (document why).

## 7) Windows/pwsh operational notes

- Default shell is pwsh; verify with `$PSVersionTable.PSEdition`. Prefer `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl` for downloads.
- Paths use backslashes on Windows but tools should accept normalized paths. Quote paths containing spaces.
- MCP GitHub tools first; VS Code integration next; `gh` CLI only when necessary—with justification.

## 8) Claude custom agent config examples

The following examples illustrate a practical config style. Save as JSONC/YAML under `./claude/agents/`. Adjust field names to your Claude runtime.

Example A — Team Lead Orchestrator (`./claude/agents/orchestrator.jsonc`)
```jsonc
{
	"name": "Team Lead Orchestrator",
	"purpose": "Plan, delegate, review, and ship; no direct implementation.",
	"system": "You orchestrate multi-agent work. Do not write code yourself. Break down tasks, delegate, collect, approve.",
	"tools": ["mcp_github_issues", "mcp_github_pull_requests", "mcp_github_repos"],
	"mcpServers": ["github"],
	"delegates": ["Researcher", "Frontend Developer", "Backend Developer", "QA Test Engineer", "Code Reviewer"],
	"delegationPolicy": {
		"maxParallel": 2,
		"requireAcceptCriteria": true,
		"pattern": "delegate-perform-approve"
	},
	"repoRoots": ["e:/src/github/nam20485/workflow-launch2"],
	"constraints": {
		"noImplementation": true,
		"shortLived": true
	}
}
```

Example B — Researcher (`./claude/agents/researcher.jsonc`)
```jsonc
{
	"name": "Researcher",
	"purpose": "Use gemini-mcp to collect broad context and produce distilled briefs with citations.",
	"system": "Research only. Use gemini-mcp tools explicitly. Return a concise brief with sources and risks.",
	"tools": ["gemini_mcp_search", "gemini_mcp_fetch"],
	"mcpServers": ["gemini-mcp"],
	"delegates": [],
	"constraints": {
		"noCodeChanges": true,
		"shortLived": true
	},
	"outputs": ["brief.md", "sources.json"]
}
```

Example C — Code Reviewer (`./claude/agents/code-reviewer.jsonc`)
```jsonc
{
	"name": "Code Reviewer",
	"purpose": "Enforce correctness, security, performance, and style; approve or request changes.",
	"system": "Review diffs and PRs. Provide specific findings and block/approve decisions.",
	"tools": ["mcp_github_pull_requests", "mcp_github_reviews"],
	"mcpServers": ["github"],
	"delegates": ["Researcher"],
	"constraints": {
		"noDirectCommits": true,
		"shortLived": true
	},
	"reviewChecklist": [
		"Tests added/updated and passing",
		"Security and dependency hygiene",
		"Performance budget respected",
		"Docs and runbooks updated"
	]
}
```

## 9) Pre-commit checklist (minimum)

- Scope small tasks; confirm acceptance criteria.
- Ensure the right agent performed the work with minimal tools.
- If research was required, verify a Researcher brief exists with sources.
- Tests exist and pass locally; QA sign-off recorded.
- Code review completed with explicit Approve.
- PR has linked issues and concise summary of changes.

Appendix — Rationale for delegation
- Long-running, multi-purpose agents accumulate context that degrades performance. Keeping agents short-lived and focused, and pushing research/auxiliary steps to specialized delegates, preserves context quality and improves outcomes.
