## Actions Executed (by assignment)

### 1) initiate-new-repository
- GitHub repository exists: https://github.com/nam20485/advanced_memory_sparrow23 (default branch aligned to `development`)
- Local working copy under workspace: `dynamic_workflows/advanced_memory_sparrow23`
- App plan docs copied and pushed to branch `development`:
  - `docs/Advanced Memory .NET - Dev Plan.md` (full content)
  - `docs/index.html` (interactive report; Chart.js instance stored to avoid linter warning)
- Labels imported (status/type/priority sets):
  - status: backlog, in progress, blocked
  - type: feature, bug, docs
  - priority: high, medium, low
- Milestones created:
  - Phase 1: Repository Initialization
  - Phase 2: Application Planning
  - Phase 3: Project Structure & Scaffolding
  - Phase 4: Core Services Implementation
  - Phase 5: Integration & End-to-End Validation
  - Phase 6: Documentation & CI/CD Hardening
- Modern GitHub Project created and verified: https://github.com/users/nam20485/projects/19
- Template initialization script implemented: `scripts/init-template-repo.ps1` (idempotent workspace/devcontainer naming)

### 2) create-app-plan
- Pending (will create planning issue/epics and assign to milestones per instructions)

### 3) create-project-structure
- .NET solution and projects scaffolded:
  - AdvancedMemory.sln with Api, Core, Shared, Tests
  - .NET Aspire Starter added (AppHost, ServiceDefaults, ApiService, Web)
- Infra and local orchestration:
  - docker-compose.yml for ApiService + GraphRagService
  - services/GraphRagService (FastAPI placeholder, Dockerfile, requirements, main.py)
  - appsettings.Development.json.example and .env.example added
- CI:
  - Sample workflow provided at `docs/ci/dotnet-ci.yml` (move to `.github/workflows/` with a token that has `workflow` scope).
- Docs:
  - README updated with quick start, CI notes, and tracking links
  - docs/DEV_SETUP.md added
  - .ai-repository-summary.md added at repo root
 - Build validation: `dotnet build` succeeded locally
