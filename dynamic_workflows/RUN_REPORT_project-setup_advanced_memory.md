## Actions Executed (by assignment)

### 1) initiate-new-repository
- GitHub repository exists: https://github.com/nam20485/advanced_memory_sparrow23 (default branch aligned to `development`)
- Local working copy under workspace: `dynamic_workflows/advanced_memory_sparrow23`
- App plan docs copied and pushed to branch `development`:
  - `docs/Advanced Memory .NET - Dev Plan.md` (full content)
  - `docs/index.html` (interactive report; Chart.js instance stored to avoid linter warning)
- Labels imported (status/type/priority sets):
  - status: backlog, in progress, blocked
  - type: feature, bug, docs
  - priority: high, medium, low
- Milestones created:
  - Phase 1: Repository Initialization
  - Phase 2: Application Planning
  - Phase 3: Project Structure & Scaffolding
  - Phase 4: Core Services Implementation
  - Phase 5: Integration & End-to-End Validation
  - Phase 6: Documentation & CI/CD Hardening
- Modern GitHub Project created and verified: https://github.com/users/nam20485/projects/19
- Template initialization script implemented: `scripts/init-template-repo.ps1` (idempotent workspace/devcontainer naming)

### 2) create-app-plan
- Pending (will create planning issue/epics and assign to milestones per instructions)

### 3) create-project-structure
- Pending (will scaffold solution/projects per instructions)

## Evidence Links
- Repository: https://github.com/nam20485/advanced_memory_sparrow23
- Project: https://github.com/users/nam20485/projects/19
- Docs (branch: development):
  - `docs/Advanced Memory .NET - Dev Plan.md`
  - `docs/index.html`

## Acceptance Criteria Results

### initiate-new-repository
1. Git repository created with proper configuration → PASS (repo live; branch set to `development`)  
2. App creation plan documents copied to `docs/` → PASS (full Markdown + HTML pushed)  
3. Git Project created for issue tracking → PASS (Project #19)  
4. Milestones created based on application plan phases → PASS (six milestones created)  
5. Labels imported for issue management → PASS (status/type/priority created)  
6. Filenames changed to match project name → PASS (workspace/devcontainer named)

### create-app-plan
- All criteria → PENDING

### create-project-structure
- All criteria → PENDING

## Issues and retries (Run #2)
- Wrong clone destination root (landed under sibling path)
  - Tries: 1 (clone succeeded but into wrong folder)
  - Fix: Safer workspace-anchored clone snippet added to ops notes
- Label import
  - Tries: 2 (first used unsupported parameter; second succeeded)
- Milestones creation
  - Tries: 1 (succeeded)
- HTML linter warning on Chart.js instance
  - Tries: 2 (restored source; assigned Chart instance to variable/global)

## Outcome
- initiate-new-repository: COMPLETE (all acceptance criteria PASS)
- Next: execute create-app-plan, then create-project-structure; update this report with evidence after each step.
