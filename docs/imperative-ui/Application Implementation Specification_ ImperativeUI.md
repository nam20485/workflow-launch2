# **Application Implementation Specification: ImperativeUI**

## **App Title**

ImperativeUI

## **Development Plan**

A detailed, phased development plan has been created and is available in the document titled: **"Development Plan: ImperativeUI"**.

## **Description**

### **Overview**

ImperativeUI is a cross-platform desktop application engineered to dynamically generate a user interface from a declarative JSON configuration file. The application parses a user-provided file that specifies variable names and their data types, and then constructs an appropriate set of UI controls for data entry and manipulation.

The core architecture is designed to be highly modular and decoupled, following a Specifier \-\> Generator \-\> Viewer pattern. This ensures that the logic for UI generation is cleanly separated from the final rendering technology, allowing for future flexibility and maintainability.

## **Requirements**

### **Features**

* \[x\] Load a declarative JSON configuration file.  
* \[x\] Dynamically generate a UI based on the configuration.  
* \[x\] Support a core set of UI controls (textbox, numeric, slider, checkbox, dropdown).  
* \[x\] Provide two-way data binding between the UI and the application's data model.  
* \[x\] Isolate the UI generation logic behind a service interface.  
* \[ \] Implement the final UI generator using a Large Language Model (LLM).  
* \[x\] Ensure the application is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* The application must successfully parse a valid input JSON file and render a corresponding UI without errors.  
* Changes made in the UI controls must be reflected in the application's internal data model.  
* The application must remain responsive during the UI generation process.  
* The final architecture must have a clear separation between the generator and the renderer modules.

## **Language**

C\#

## **Language Version**

.NET 9.0 (or latest stable)

## **Frameworks, Tools, Packages**

* **UI Framework:** Avalonia  
* **Architectural Pattern:** MVVM  
* **MVVM Toolkit:** CommunityToolkit.Mvvm  
* **AI Integration (Future):** A library for interacting with LLM APIs (e.g., Azure.AI.OpenAI or a direct HttpClient implementation).

## **Project Structure/Package System**

The solution will be structured into three distinct projects:

1. ImperativeUI.Core: A .NET class library for shared models and interfaces.  
2. ImperativeUI.Generator: A .NET class library for the UI generation logic.  
3. ImperativeUI.Desktop: The main Avalonia application for the UI and rendering.

## **GitHub**

### **Repo**

To be created.

### **Branch**

main for stable releases, develop for active development.

## **Deliverables**

* A fully functional cross-platform desktop application.  
* Source code hosted in a Git repository.  
* Documentation covering the intermediate UI JSON schema.
