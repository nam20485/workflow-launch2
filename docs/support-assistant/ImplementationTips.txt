1. Project Setup & Dependencies
-
Start by creating an Avalonia MVVM application. Install the `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` NuGet package to get both GPU acceleration and a CPU fallback. Add your optimized `.onnx` model files to an `Assets` folder and ensure they are copied to the output directory.

2. Create an Inference Service
-
Encapsulate all ONNX Runtime logic in a dedicated service class. Initialize the `InferenceSession` with `SessionOptions` to enable the DirectML execution provider. Expose an `async` method to run inference, which takes a prompt, handles tokenization, prepares input tensors, and decodes the output. Crucially, ensure the `InferenceSession` is properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks.

3. Build a Responsive UI
-
In the `ViewModel`, use an `ObservableCollection` to store chat messages. Bind this to an `ItemsControl` in your View. Implement `async` command handlers that call the inference service. Use a boolean property (e.g., `IsBusy`) to show/hide loading indicators and disable input controls while the model is processing, ensuring the UI never freezes.

4. Handle Onboarding & Edge Cases
-
On first launch, check for model files and provide a user-friendly download manager if they're missing. The initial, one-time model compilation can take minutes; run this on a background thread and show a clear notification to the user. Wrap all AI-related initializations in `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors on systems with insufficient hardware.
