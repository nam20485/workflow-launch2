## **Application Title:**

### **SupportAssistant**

## **Application Synopsis:**

This document outlines the complete technical and architectural specifications for a freeware, open-source Windows desktop application. It is engineered to provide intelligent, contextual technical assistance to users regarding prevalent system configurations, operational issues, and software troubleshooting. The application utilizes a local, on-device Small Language Model (SLM) to interpret user queries in natural language, search a curated and verifiable knowledge base for pertinent solutions, and furnish actionable guidance. A distinguishing characteristic of the application is its capacity to function as an intelligent agent, capable of executing system modifications—such as the alteration of configuration files, registry keys, and user interface settings—subsequent to receiving explicit, granular user authorization for each proposed action.

The foundational architecture is designed with a principal focus on three strategic imperatives: absolute user data confidentiality, robust offline operational capability, and the long-term financial viability of a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) distribution model. This on-device paradigm obviates recurring operational expenditures for the developer, a critical factor for sustainable FOSS projects, and fosters user trust by ensuring sensitive system information never leaves the local machine.

## **Target Platform Specification:**

* **Primary Compatibility:** Windows 10 and Windows 11, with native support for both x64 and ARM64 processor architectures to ensure maximum reach across the Windows device ecosystem.  
* **Optimal Performance Environment:** Windows 11, version 24H2 or subsequent releases. This environment is highly recommended as it enables the application to fully leverage the integrated Windows ML platform. This integration facilitates automatic, OS-level hardware acceleration across the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and Neural Processing Unit (NPU). This not only maximizes performance and energy efficiency but also abstracts the complexities of hardware-specific dependencies, significantly reducing the application's package size and simplifying deployment.  
* **User Interface Framework:** The application will be developed utilizing Avalonia UI. This modern framework has been selected because it provides a clear, maintainable pathway for porting the single C\# codebase to other operating systems, such as macOS and Linux, should the project's scope expand in the future.

## **User Interface Framework:**

**Avalonia UI** has been selected as the designated framework for all user interface development.

* **Rationale:** The selection of Avalonia UI is predicated on its robust cross-platform capabilities and its modern, high-performance rendering architecture. It permits the application to be developed once in C\# and deployed natively on Windows, while retaining the potential for future expansion to macOS and Linux. The framework provides a development experience analogous to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), employing the declarative and highly structured XAML syntax for UI definition. This approach is conducive to building complex, maintainable user interfaces and offers comprehensive support for modern, testable architectural patterns. A significant technical merit of Avalonia is its utilization of the Skia 2D graphics library for direct UI rendering. This ensures a consistent, pixel-perfect presentation and high-fidelity custom controls across all supported operating systems, thus mitigating the visual and behavioral inconsistencies often associated with frameworks that rely on wrapping native OS controls.  
* **Architectural Pattern:** The application's structure will strictly adhere to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. As the standard and recommended methodology for enterprise-grade Avalonia development, MVVM ensures a rigorous separation of concerns. This decouples the user interface (the View) from the application logic and state (the ViewModel), which in turn is decoupled from the application's data structures (the Model). This separation enhances testability, maintainability, and facilitates parallel development of the UI and the underlying business logic.

## **Core Application Logic and Architecture:**

### **1\. AI Inference Architecture: On-Device (Local)**

The application will operate exclusively on an on-device inference model, a cornerstone of its design. This paradigm is fundamental to the FOSS distribution strategy, as it externalizes recurring computational costs to the end-user's hardware, thereby nullifying any per-query financial liability for the developer. This approach stands in stark contrast to cloud-based API models, whose costs scale with usage and would render a free application financially unsustainable. Furthermore, this architecture ensures maximal user privacy by confining all data processing—including user prompts and system diagnostics—to the local machine. This fosters a high degree of user trust, which is critical for an application that may request permissions for system modifications, and facilitates complete, uninterrupted offline functionality.

### **2\. AI Task Architecture: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

To guarantee the veracity, accuracy, and contextual relevance of generated responses, the core artificial intelligence logic will be founded upon a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This multi-stage process is essential for grounding the SLM in factual data and preventing the generation of erroneous or misleading information, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "hallucination."

* **Retrieval Phase:** Upon receiving a user query, the application will first transform the natural language input into a vector embedding. This embedding is then used to perform a high-speed similarity search against a pre-compiled local vector database. This search identifies the most applicable technical documentation snippets from the curated knowledge base.  
* **Augmentation Phase:** The original user query is then algorithmically combined with the content of the retrieved documents. This process constructs a single, contextually enriched prompt that provides the SLM with both the user's intent and the relevant factual data required to formulate an accurate answer.  
* **Generation Phase:** Finally, this augmented prompt is processed by the local SLM, which is specifically instructed to synthesize a helpful and factually grounded response based *only* on the provided context. For example, if a user asks for a specific command-line flag, this process ensures the model provides the exact flag from the retrieved documentation rather than inventing a plausible but incorrect alternative.

### **3\. Agentic Capabilities Architecture: Function Calling (Tool Utilization)**

To empower the AI with the capacity for direct system modification, it will be implemented as an intelligent agent capable of "function calling," a paradigm also referred to as "tool use." This architecture provides a secure and structured method for the AI to interact with the broader system.

* **Tool Definition:** A discrete set of C\# functions will be meticulously defined, with each function representing a single, specific, and granular operation (e.g., ModifyRegistryKey, EditIniFile, ChangeDisplayScaling). Each tool will be strongly typed and documented.  
* **Model-Directed Action:** The SLM will be furnished with a manifest, or a structured description, of the available tools, including their purpose and required parameters. In response to a user request that necessitates an action, the model will not generate code but will instead generate a structured JSON object. This object specifies the designated tool to be invoked and the precise parameters to be used.  
* **Secure Execution:** The C\# application will then parse this JSON output, validate it against a strict schema, and, only upon successful validation, invoke the corresponding C\# function. This methodology ensures that the SLM is fully abstracted from direct code execution, establishing a critical security demarcation that prevents the model from performing arbitrary or unintended actions.  
* **Orchestration Layer:** A dedicated framework such as **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** or the **Microsoft.Extensions.AI** library will serve as an orchestration layer. This layer will manage the entire function-calling loop, simplifying the process of defining tools, managing conversational state, and handling the model's responses, thereby streamlining development.

## **AI/ML Model Specification:**

* **Model:** **Microsoft Phi-3-mini**. This specific Small Language Model (SLM) is selected for its commendable performance-to-size ratio and its advanced instruction-following capabilities. Its relatively small VRAM and system memory footprint render it optimally suited for on-device deployment on consumer-grade hardware, where it must coexist efficiently with other running applications.  
* **Licensing:** **MIT License**. The model is governed by this permissive open-source license, which authorizes free use, modification, and distribution for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. This legal framework aligns seamlessly with the non-commercial, community-driven objectives of this FOSS initiative.  
* **Format:** **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**. The application will utilize the official, pre-optimized ONNX-formatted versions of the Phi-3 model. This strategy is critical as it obviates the need for developers to perform complex and error-prone model conversion and quantization processes, ensuring peak performance and compatibility within the Windows AI ecosystem out-of-the-box.

## **AI/ML Integration Strategy:**

* **Runtime Engine:** **ONNX Runtime**. This high-performance, cross-platform inference engine, maintained by Microsoft, is designated for the loading and execution of the ONNX model. Its proven stability and performance are essential for a responsive user experience.  
* **Hardware Acceleration:** The **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML** NuGet package will be integrated as a primary dependency. This package leverages **DirectML**, a low-level DirectX 12-based API that furnishes a unified hardware acceleration layer for GPUs and NPUs from all major vendors (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm). This effectively addresses the significant engineering challenge of hardware heterogeneity, eliminating the need for separate, vendor-specific code paths (e.g., for CUDA or ROCm).  
* **Operating System-Level Integration (Recommended):** For applications specifically targeting Windows 11 24H2 or later, the **Windows ML** platform will be employed via the Microsoft.Windows.AI.MachineLearning NuGet package. Windows ML functions as a high-level abstraction layer, intelligently managing the ONNX Runtime and its underlying execution providers. This simplifies application deployment by reducing package size, delegating dependency management to the OS, and future-proofing the application against updates in the AI stack.

## **Data Sources and Management:**

The application's knowledge base will be meticulously curated from high-quality, publicly available technical documentation. A dedicated, automated pre-processing pipeline will be engineered to periodically retrieve, filter, chunk, and index this content into a local vector database that is then distributed with the application.

* **Primary Data Sources:**  
  * **Microsoft Learn:** Programmatic data acquisition will be performed using the Microsoft Graph APIs or the Content Understanding REST API to access official Windows documentation, tutorials, and technical articles.  
  * **Stack Overflow:** Data will be accessed programmatically via the Stack Exchange API v3, targeting specific tags relevant to Windows administration and development. The data retrieval pipeline will be designed to strictly adhere to all specified API rate limitations to ensure responsible access.  
* **Quality Assurance Filtering (Stack Overflow):** To ensure the reliability of information sourced from community platforms, a quality score will be computed for each retrieved answer. This score will be derived from a weighted algorithm that considers the answer's upvote count, its status as the "accepted" solution, and potentially the reputation of the author. This leverages the platform's intrinsic community validation mechanisms to filter for high-quality, trustworthy solutions.

## **Key Functional Features:**

* Provision of a responsive, modern chat interface enabling users to submit complex technical inquiries using natural, conversational language.  
* Delivery of factually grounded, verifiable responses, ensured by the RAG architecture's strict reliance on a curated and trusted knowledge base.  
* Execution of agentic system modifications, contingent upon explicit, multi-stage user consent for each proposed action. This includes alterations to .ini files, Windows Registry keys, and UI settings via the UI Automation framework, with a clear preview of changes before execution.  
* Unyielding adherence to a privacy-first doctrine, wherein all user data, conversations, and system queries are processed exclusively on the local device and are never transmitted to any external server.  
* Full, uninterrupted offline operational capability for all core functionalities, including chat and knowledge base search.  
* A fully cross-platform user interface, constructed with Avalonia for a consistent, high-quality user experience and future-proofed for potential deployment on macOS and Linux.

## **Security Architecture and Considerations:**

Endowing an AI agent with system-level access necessitates the implementation of a multi-layered, rigorous security model to protect the user and the system.

* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Protocol:** The paramount security principle is the mandatory and non-negotiable implementation of a HITL protocol. The agent is explicitly prohibited from executing any system-modifying action autonomously. It must first generate a transparent, human-readable plan of action and present it to the user for explicit approval prior to execution.  
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Each tool accessible to the agent will be narrowly circumscribed in its functionality to perform a single, specific action. It will operate with the absolute minimum system permissions required for its designated function, preventing any possibility of privilege escalation.  
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** All user prompts will undergo rigorous sanitization to mitigate the risk of prompt injection vulnerabilities. Furthermore, all JSON outputs from the model intended for tool use will be validated against a strict schema before being parsed and acted upon.  
* **Sandboxing and Containment:** Wherever feasible, agent-initiated actions will be isolated. For instance, file modifications will be performed on a temporary copy, which will only replace the original file after successful user validation.  
* **Auditing and Rollback Mechanisms:** All actions executed by the agent will be logged in a clear, accessible audit trail within the application. The application will furnish a robust mechanism to review and revert any system changes, such as by automatically creating backups of registry keys and configuration files before any modification is attempted.

## **Deployment and Distribution Strategy:**

* The application will be disseminated via a standard, digitally signed Windows installer package to ensure authenticity and integrity.  
* The application can be packaged as an **MSIX** bundle. This modern packaging format is highly suitable for frictionless distribution through the Microsoft Store and simplifies enterprise deployment and management via tools such as Microsoft Intune. MSIX also provides enhanced security through application containerization and ensures a clean, reliable installation and uninstallation process.  
* The optimized ONNX model and the pre-compiled knowledge base index will be incorporated directly into the installer package. This ensures immediate, out-of-the-box functionality upon installation, with no requirement for additional downloads or configuration steps by the end-user.
