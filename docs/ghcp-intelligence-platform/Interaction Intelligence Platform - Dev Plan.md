# **Development Plan & Specification**

## **Project: Interaction Intelligence Platform v1.0**

Version: 1.0  
Date: August 13, 2025  
Author: Gemini AI, Application Design Specialist

## **1\. Vision & Application Philosophy**

The Interaction Intelligence Platform is a new class of developer tooling designed to provide **observability, explainability, and optimization** for the collaborative partnership between a human developer and an AI coding assistant like GitHub Copilot.

Our core philosophy is **"Trust by Design."** The application is fundamentally a personal, private, and secure tool for self-improvement and workflow mastery. It empowers developers by demystifying the AI "black box" and transforming their interaction data into actionable intelligence. V1.0 is exclusively a **local-first** application; no user data ever leaves the user's machine.

## **2\. Application Layout & Architecture**

### **2.1. High-Level Architecture**

The platform is a modular, multi-process system composed of three main components:

1. **Desktop Client (The Hub):** The primary user-facing application where all visualization, analysis, and interaction occur.  
2. **Local Proxy Service (The Collector):** A background service responsible for intercepting and capturing raw API traffic.  
3. **VS Code Extension (The Instrument):** A lightweight extension for deep integration with the IDE, providing real-time context.

### **2.2. Software Stack & Frameworks**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Desktop Client** | **.NET 8+ / C\#** with **Avalonia UI** | Provides a modern, cross-platform UI framework that allows for a single codebase across Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring a consistent user experience. |
| **Services & Backend** | **.NET Aspire** | An ideal choice for orchestrating the multi-process nature of our application. Aspire simplifies the management of the desktop client, the proxy service, and any future backend analysis components. |
| **API Proxy Service** | **ASP.NET Core Web API** | A high-performance framework perfect for building the local proxy. We will use YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) for its efficiency and extensibility in handling network traffic. |
| **Database** | **ArangoDB** | A high-performance, multi-model database that natively supports both document (NoSQL) and graph data models. This is the ideal choice for our complex data relationships, enabling powerful graph queries for deep analysis while remaining flexible. It will be run locally in a single-server mode. |
| **VS Code Extension** | **TypeScript** | This is the standard for VS Code extensions. It offers strong typing and excellent integration with the VS Code API. |
| **CI/CD** | **GitHub Actions** | Native integration with the code repository for building, testing, and packaging the application for all target platforms. |
| **Testing** | **xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq** | A robust, industry-standard stack for .NET testing, ensuring code quality and reliability. |

### **2.3. VS Code Extension Integration Strategy**

The .NET desktop app and the TypeScript VS Code extension will communicate via **SignalR**, running over a local WebSocket connection.

1. The .NET application will host a **SignalR Hub** on a designated local port.  
2. The TypeScript extension will use the official @microsoft/signalr client to establish a persistent connection to this Hub.  
3. Communication will leverage SignalR's **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** model. The extension will invoke methods on the Hub (e.g., hub.invoke("ReportIdeEvent", eventData)) to stream real-time context.  
4. This approach is superior to raw WebSockets as it provides a strongly-typed, more maintainable communication protocol with built-in connection management and resilience.

## **3\. Feature Specification & Phased Rollout**

### **Phase 1: Core Local Experience & Trust Foundation**

*(Objective: To deliver a high-value, secure, and robust single-player application that establishes a strong foundation of user trust through transparent and privacy-preserving features. This phase focuses on core data capture, security, and fundamental UI presentation.)*

#### **F-101: Multi-Source Log Aggregation**

* **Epic:** Multi-Source Log Aggregation  
* **User Story:** As a power user, I want the application to automatically capture and unify data from all relevant Copilot and IDE sources, so that I have a complete, correlated dataset to analyze without manual intervention.  
* **Description:** This foundational feature establishes the data ingestion pipeline. The application will actively monitor the standard log output locations for the GitHub Copilot extensions and stream events from the VS Code Extension. The primary challenge is to normalize these disparate data sources into a single, coherent event schema that can be stored and queried effectively.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** the application is running, **when** a new log entry is written by the Copilot Chat Debug View, **then** the entry is parsed and stored in the database within 2 seconds.  
  2. **Given** the application is running, **when** a code selection event is emitted by the VS Code extension, **then** that event is received and stored in the database.  
  3. **Given** multiple events from different sources occur within the same session, **when** the data is stored, **then** all events are linked to a common session identifier.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * A file-watching service will monitor the VS Code log directories for changes.  
  * A robust parsing engine with distinct strategies for each log format will be required. Parsers must be resilient to minor format changes in future extension updates.  
  * A unified Event data model will be designed for storage in ArangoDB, featuring fields like Timestamp, SessionID, Source (e.g., 'API\_Proxy', 'Debug\_Log', 'IDE\_Extension'), EventType, and a flexible Payload document.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Implement file-watching service for log directories, develop parsers for each log format, design the unified ArangoDB event collection schema, implement the SignalR endpoint for receiving IDE events.

#### **F-102: "Deep Diagnostics Consent" Wizard**

* **Epic:** Deep Diagnostics Consent Wizard  
* **User Story:** As a new user, I want a clear, step-by-step process to understand and approve the network inspection feature, so that I can feel confident and secure in my decision.  
* **Description:** This feature implements the critical consent flow for enabling API interception. It is not a simple dialog but a multi-step "wizard" that educates the user before asking for consent, embodying the "Trust by Design" philosophy. The flow must be clear, transparent, and user-initiated.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** API interception is disabled, **when** the user clicks the "Enable Deep Diagnostics" button, **then** a modal wizard appears with an initial screen explaining the purpose and benefits of the feature.  
  2. **Given** the user is on the explanation screen, **when** they proceed, **then** the wizard presents a second screen detailing the technical requirement of a local security certificate and explicitly stating that all traffic remains on the local machine.  
  3. **Given** the user is on the certificate explanation screen, **when** they proceed, **then** the wizard presents the final consent button, which is disabled for 5 seconds to encourage reading, and is labeled "I Understand and Authorize Local Network Inspection."  
  4. **Given** the user has not completed the wizard, **when** they close it at any step, **then** the feature remains disabled and no system changes are made.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The wizard should be implemented as a modal dialog with a clear progression state (e.g., Step 1 of 3).  
  * The user's consent status must be stored persistently and securely in the application's local settings. This setting should be checked before the proxy service is ever launched.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the multi-step wizard UI flow, implement the modal dialog framework, write clear and concise educational content for each step, implement the persistent state management for user consent.

#### **F-103: Automated & Guided Certificate Installation**

* **Epic:** Automated & Guided Certificate Installation  
* **User Story:** As a new user, I want the application to handle the complex process of installing the required security certificate for me, so that I can enable API interception quickly and without errors.  
* **Description:** This feature provides a wizard-like, step-by-step process for installing the local proxy's self-signed root certificate into the system's trust store. The goal is to automate this technically complex process as much as possible, abstracting away platform differences while maintaining transparency and requiring explicit user consent for administrative actions.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** the user has given consent in the "Deep Diagnostics Consent" wizard, **when** the installation process begins, **then** the application first generates a unique root CA certificate.  
  2. **Given** the certificate is generated, **when** the application is about to install it, **then** it prompts the user for administrative privileges using the native OS dialog.  
  3. **Given** the user provides administrative credentials, **when** the installation is attempted, **then** the application executes the platform-specific command to install the certificate into the system's root trust store.  
  4. **Given** the installation succeeds, **when** the process completes, **then** the application displays a clear success message and automatically proceeds.  
  5. **Given** the installation fails for any reason (e.g., user denies credentials), **when** an error occurs, **then** the application displays a user-friendly error message with a link to detailed troubleshooting documentation.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The application will generate a root CA certificate using .NET's System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates APIs, with a clearly identifiable name (e.g., "Interaction Intelligence Platform Proxy CA").  
  * The process that performs the installation must be launched with elevated privileges. This will require careful implementation to adhere to security best practices on each platform.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Implement certificate generation logic, develop the UI wizard for the guided installation, implement the platform-specific installation commands (for Windows, macOS, and major Linux distributions), implement the privilege elevation request logic, create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation.

#### **F-104: "Safe Sessions" Vault**

* **Epic:** "Safe Sessions" Vault  
* **User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all captured sensitive data to be encrypted on disk, so that I can be sure my data is protected even if my machine is lost, stolen, or compromised.  
* **Description:** This feature implements the core encryption-at-rest strategy. All potentially sensitive data captured by the proxy (e.g., API request/response bodies containing source code) will be immediately encrypted before being written to the ArangoDB database. Metadata may remain unencrypted to facilitate querying. This data can only be viewed during an active, unlocked session.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** the application is capturing API traffic, **when** a document is written to the database, **then** its sensitive payload fields are encrypted using AES-256.  
  2. **Given** the application starts, **when** the user attempts to view a session's details for the first time, **then** they are prompted to unlock the vault using their configured authentication method (password or system biometrics).  
  3. **Given** the vault is locked, **when** the user attempts to view encrypted data fields, **then** the UI displays a placeholder (e.g., "\[Content Encrypted \- Unlock Vault to View\]") instead of the decrypted content.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * A robust cryptographic service will be implemented using System.Security.Cryptography.Aes.  
  * The encryption key will be derived from the user's master password using a strong key derivation function like PBKDF2 (Rfc2898DeriveBytes) with a high iteration count.  
  * For biometric unlocking, the application will integrate with platform-specific credential managers (Windows Hello, macOS Keychain) to securely store and retrieve the master key, avoiding the need for the user to re-enter a password.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Implement the core encryption/decryption service, design the ArangoDB data model to distinguish between encrypted and unencrypted fields, implement the vault lock/unlock UI flow, implement the integration with system credential managers.

#### **F-105: Unified Thread View**

* **Epic:** Unified Thread View  
* **User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my chat conversation alongside the detailed technical logs, so that I can easily correlate my actions with the AI's behavior.  
* **Description:** This is the primary data exploration view of the application. It presents a familiar and intuitive two-panel layout: the left side shows a clean, rendered view of the chat conversation, while the right side shows the detailed, structured log data for the selected interaction. The view is designed for fluid navigation and deep inspection.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a session is loaded, **when** the main screen is viewed, **then** a list of chat messages, rendered as chat bubbles, is displayed on the left.  
  2. **Given** a user clicks on a specific chat message, **when** the selection changes, **then** the right panel updates in under 200ms to show the full log entry, including prompt, context, and API response for that message.  
  3. **Given** the right panel displays data, **when** the data contains collapsible sections (like a JSON payload or HTTP headers), **then** these sections are initially collapsed and can be expanded by the user.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The UI will be built around a SplitView control for the two-panel layout.  
  * The left panel will be a ListBox with UI virtualization enabled to ensure performance with very long conversations, using a custom DataTemplate to render the chat bubbles.  
  * The right panel will use a combination of controls, including a TreeView for JSON payloads, to create a rich, interactive display of the structured log data. Data binding will be used extensively to link the UI to the underlying data model.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the two-panel layout, create the chat bubble UI component, create the expandable log viewer component with support for various data types, implement the efficient selection and data-binding logic.

#### **F-106: Session Security UI**

* **Epic:** Session Security UI  
* **User Story:** As a user, I want clear, persistent feedback about the security state of my session, so that I can confidently use the application and know when my sensitive data is decrypted.  
* **Description:** This feature ensures the user is always aware of the application's security context. It provides ambient visual cues and explicit controls for managing the "Safe Session" vault, making security an ever-present, understandable aspect of the user experience.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** the vault is unlocked, **when** the user is using the application, **then** the main window has a distinct, non-intrusive colored border (e.g., a 2px solid yellow border) and a visible "Unlocked" icon in the status bar.  
  2. **Given** the vault is locked, **when** the user is using the application, **then** the colored border and "Unlocked" icon are not present.  
  3. **Given** the application is running, **when** the user clicks the "Lock Session" button in the toolbar, **then** the vault is immediately locked, all decrypted data is cleared from memory, and the UI updates to the locked state.  
  4. **Given** the vault is unlocked and there is no user activity (mouse movement or keyboard input) for a configurable period (default 15 minutes), **when** the timer expires, **then** the vault automatically locks itself.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * A global state manager service will track the vault's IsLocked status.  
  * The main window's style and the visibility of status bar icons will be bound to this state.  
  * A DispatcherTimer will be used to implement the inactivity auto-lock feature, resetting on any user input event.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the specific visual indicators (border color, icons), implement the "Lock Session" button and its associated logic, implement the global inactivity timer and its event listeners.

#### **F-107: Basic Performance Metrics**

* **Epic:** Basic Performance Metrics  
* **User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the basic performance data for each AI interaction, so that I can quickly identify slow or expensive requests.  
* **Description:** This feature surfaces the most critical performance metrics directly within the Unified Thread View for each interaction. The goal is to make performance data an integral part of the analysis, not an afterthought.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a user has selected a chat interaction in the Unified Thread View, **when** they view the details panel, **then** a dedicated "Performance" section is clearly visible at the top.  
  2. **Given** the "Performance" section is visible, **when** it is inspected, **then** it displays the Duration (ms), Time to First Token (ms), and total Token Count.  
  3. **Given** the token count is displayed, **when** the user hovers over it, **then** a tooltip appears with a detailed breakdown: Prompt Tokens: \[value\] and Completion Tokens: \[value\].  
  4. **Given** the Duration exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 5000ms), **when** it is displayed, **then** the value is highlighted in a distinct color (e.g., orange) to draw attention to it.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * These metrics will be parsed from the captured log and API data and stored as top-level fields in the ArangoDB document for efficient retrieval.  
  * The UI will use simple TextBlock elements for display, with a ToolTip for the token breakdown and a DataTrigger for the conditional highlighting.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Parse and store performance data from all sources, design the metrics display UI panel, implement the tooltip for the token breakdown, implement the conditional highlighting for slow requests.

### **Phase 2: From Insight to Action — Advanced Analytics & Interactive Tooling**

*(Goal: Transform the raw data into actionable intelligence and provide powerful "what-if" capabilities.)*

#### **F-201: Interaction Quality Report**

* **Epic:** Interaction Quality Report  
* **User Story:** As a developer trying to improve my AI collaboration skills, I want a detailed analysis of my prompts, so that I can understand my strengths and weaknesses and learn how to get better results.  
* **Description:** This is an on-demand analysis feature that evaluates a conversational turn against a rubric of prompt engineering best practices. It provides a structured report with scores, positive reinforcement, and actionable recommendations.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** I have selected an interaction, **when** I click "Generate Quality Report," **then** a view appears with a summary radar chart and detailed sections for Clarity, Context, and Instruction Quality.  
  2. **Given** the report is displayed, **when** a category scores highly, **then** it includes a specific "Well Done" message explaining the effective technique used.  
  3. **Given** the report is displayed, **when** a category has room for improvement, **then** it provides a specific "Recommendation" with an example of a better prompt.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The analysis engine will use a set of heuristic rules and NLP techniques (e.g., keyword spotting for vague terms, checking for persona-setting phrases).  
  * The radar chart can be implemented using a suitable Avalonia charting library.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Develop the analysis engine rubric, design the report UI with radar chart, implement the heuristic rules for each category.

#### **F-202: Automated Remediation**

* **Epic:** Automated Remediation  
* **User Story:** As a user receiving feedback from the Quality Report, I want a one-click way to apply the suggested improvements, so that I can learn by doing and immediately see the impact of a better prompt.  
* **Description:** This feature directly integrates with the Interaction Quality Report. When the report generates a recommendation to improve a prompt, it will also offer an interactive button to apply that change directly.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** the Quality Report suggests a specific prompt improvement, **when** the recommendation is displayed, **then** a button labeled "✨ Improve My Prompt" is also shown.  
  2. **Given** I click the "Improve My Prompt" button, **when** the action is confirmed, **then** the text in my chat input box is updated with the suggested prompt, ready for me to send.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * This requires communication from the desktop app back to the VS Code extension to update the chat input UI. This can be achieved via the SignalR connection.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the "Improve Prompt" UI component, implement the SignalR method for updating the VS Code UI, write the logic for generating the improved prompt text.

#### **F-203: The Prompt Simulator**

* **Epic:** The Prompt Simulator  
* **User Story:** As a prompt engineer, I want to experiment with variations of a past interaction in a controlled environment, so that I can perform A/B testing and understand how changes affect the AI's response.  
* **Description:** This is an advanced "what-if" tool. It allows a user to select any past interaction and enter a simulation mode where they can freely edit the original prompt and context, then re-run the request against the AI to see a live-diff of the new response.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** I have selected a past interaction, **when** I enter "Simulation Mode," **then** the UI shows the original prompt, context, and response.  
  2. **Given** I am in simulation mode, **when** I edit the prompt text and click "Re-run," **then** a new request is sent to the AI and the new response is displayed alongside the original, with differences highlighted.  
  3. **Given** a new response is generated, **when** I view it, **then** the new performance metrics (latency, tokens) are also displayed for comparison.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The simulator will need to reconstruct the full request payload from the logged data.  
  * It will use the same underlying service that sends real chat messages to send the simulated request.  
  * A text diffing library will be needed to highlight the changes between the original and new responses.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the simulation mode UI, implement the request reconstruction logic, integrate a text diffing component, implement the comparison view.

#### **F-204: Interactive Timeline View**

* **Epic:** Interactive Timeline View  
* **User Story:** As a user reviewing my work, I want to see a visual timeline of my entire session, so that I can understand the story of my workflow and identify key moments or bottlenecks.  
* **Description:** This feature provides an alternative, graphical view of a session's data. It plots all captured events (chat, code edits, completions, errors) on a horizontal, zoomable timeline.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a session is loaded, **when** I switch to the "Timeline View," **then** I see a graphical timeline with nodes representing different event types.  
  2. **Given** I am viewing the timeline, **when** I hover over an event node, **then** a tooltip appears with a summary of the event.  
  3. **Given** I click on an event node, **when** the selection changes, **then** the application navigates to that event in the Unified Thread View.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * This will require a custom-drawn canvas or a sophisticated charting library that supports timeline visualizations.  
  * The timeline must support zooming and panning.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Select or build a timeline visualization component, design the event node visuals, implement the zoom/pan logic, implement the navigation link to the thread view.

#### **F-205: Token Flow Visualization**

* **Epic:** Token Flow Visualization  
* **User Story:** As a developer trying to optimize my AI interactions, I want to understand what makes up my prompt's token count, so that I can make more efficient use of the context window.  
* **Description:** This feature provides an intuitive, graphical breakdown of the prompt's token composition. It helps users understand the "cost" of different types of context.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** I have selected an interaction, **when** I view its details, **then** I see a Sankey diagram or a similar chart.  
  2. **Given** the chart is displayed, **when** I view it, **then** it shows distinct flows for "User Prompt," "Chat History," and "Code Context," with their respective token counts, all merging into the "Total Prompt Tokens" block.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * Requires a charting library that supports Sankey diagrams.  
  * The data will be parsed from the usage block in the log data.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Select a charting library, design the Sankey diagram, implement the data parsing and binding logic.

#### **F-206: Context Map**

* **Epic:** Context Map  
* **User Story:** As a user of workspace-level commands, I want to see exactly which files the AI used as context, so that I can debug why it might be misunderstanding my project.  
* **Description:** This feature provides critical transparency for commands like @workspace. It renders a simple, read-only file tree of the user's project, visually highlighting the files and code snippets that were automatically included in the prompt's context.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** I have selected an interaction that used @workspace, **when** I view the details, **then** a "Context Map" panel is visible.  
  2. **Given** the Context Map is visible, **when** I view it, **then** it displays a file tree where the files included as context are highlighted.  
  3. **Given** I click on a highlighted file in the map, **when** the selection changes, **then** the view shows the specific snippet of code from that file that was sent to the AI.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The log data must contain the file paths and line numbers of the included context.  
  * A TreeView control can be used to render the file structure.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the Context Map UI, implement the parsing of context file paths from logs, implement the file tree display and highlighting.

### **Phase 3: Workflow Integration & Extensibility**

*(Objective: To embed the platform's intelligence directly into the developer's daily workflow, transforming analytical insights into tangible productivity gains and fostering a culture of continuous learning.)*

#### **F-301: Prompt Snippets & Templates**

* **Epic:** Prompt Snippets & Templates  
* **User Story:** As a developer who frequently performs similar tasks, I want to persist my most effective prompts as reusable templates, in order to facilitate consistency and improve operational efficiency.  
* **Description:** This functionality enables users to create, manage, and execute a personal library of prompt templates. These templates will support placeholders for the dynamic injection of contextual data, such as the currently selected code block, which transforms static text into a dynamic, context-aware tool. This feature is intended to reduce repetitive typing and codify successful interaction patterns.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a user is viewing a successful interaction, **when** the "Save as Template" action is invoked, **then** a dialog appears prompting for a template name and allowing for edits.  
  2. **Given** a user has saved templates, **when** the "Templates" library view is accessed, **then** a manageable list of all user-created templates is displayed.  
  3. **Given** a user is within the VS Code environment, **when** a command such as "Interaction Platform: Insert Template" is executed, **then** a Quick Pick UI allows for the selection of a template, which is subsequently inserted into the chat input, resolving any placeholders like {{selected\_code}} with the active editor's context.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * Templates will be persisted as structured documents within the local ArangoDB instance.  
  * The VS Code extension will require a new command registration in its package.json and an associated command handler that communicates with the desktop client via SignalR to fetch the list of templates.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the template management UI, implement the database schema and service for template storage, create the VS Code command and Quick Pick interface, implement the placeholder resolution logic.

#### **F-302: Automated Session Summarization**

* **Epic:** Automated Session Summarization  
* **User Story:** As a developer concluding a work session, I want to generate an automated summary of my AI interactions, to streamline the documentation of work accomplished and assist in the generation of artifacts such as pull request descriptions.  
* **Description:** Upon the conclusion of a "Safe Session," this feature allows the user to initiate an AI-driven summarization process. The platform will condense the entire sequence of interactions—questions, code snippets, and AI-generated solutions—into a coherent narrative. The output will be a concise, well-structured Markdown document that highlights the key technical challenges and their resolutions.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a session containing multiple interactions has concluded, **when** the "Generate Session Summary" action is triggered, **then** the application makes a request to an AI model to generate a summary.  
  2. **Given** the summary is successfully generated, **when** it is displayed to the user, **then** it must contain a logical summary of problems, key solutions, and direct links to the most significant code snippets that were created.  
  3. **Given** the user approves the summary, **when** the "Save" action is invoked, **then** the summary is persisted as a Markdown file within the current project's directory.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * This functionality will be realized by making a meta-request to an AI model. The prompt for this request will be carefully constructed from a condensed, structured representation of the entire chat history to ensure a high-quality summary.  
  * A background task should be used for the generation process to keep the UI responsive.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Implement the session data condensation and formatting logic, design the summary generation prompt, implement the UI for displaying, editing, and saving the summary, implement the background task for AI generation.

#### **F-303: Conversation Trajectory Analysis**

* **Epic:** Conversation Trajectory Analysis  
* **User Story:** As a reflective practitioner, I want to visualize the thematic evolution of my thought process during a complex task, to gain deeper insights into my cognitive and problem-solving methodologies.  
* **Description:** This feature provides an advanced analytical view that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) topic modeling to analyze the semantic content of a conversation over time. It renders a visualization of the thematic evolution, showing how a developer's focus shifts from one concept to another during a problem-solving session.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a session is loaded, **when** the "Analyze Trajectory" function is selected, **then** a visualization is rendered in a dedicated view.  
  2. **Given** the visualization is displayed, **when** it is inspected, **then** it clearly delineates the dominant semantic topics at various points in the conversation (e.g., showing a transition from "Database Connection Error" to "SQL Query Optimization" and finally to "API Endpoint Refactoring").  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The implementation necessitates a locally executable NLP library with topic modeling capabilities (e.g., a .NET wrapper for a compact, efficient model like MiniLM).  
  * The visualization could be a stacked area chart showing topic prevalence over time, or a more complex force-directed graph illustrating the relationships between topics.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Select and integrate a suitable NLP topic modeling library, design the trajectory visualization component, implement the data analysis pipeline to process session text, and bind the results to the visualization.

#### **F-304: Knowledge Base Integration**

* **Epic:** Knowledge Base Integration  
* **User Story:** As a user who meticulously documents solutions, I want to seamlessly export valuable AI interactions to my personal knowledge base, in order to construct a personalized, searchable repository of proven solutions.  
* **Description:** This feature, planned for a future release, will introduce an Application Programming Interface (API) and a plugin architecture to facilitate integration with popular local-first knowledge management tools, such as Obsidian and Logseq. The initial implementation will focus on a direct, file-based export.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. **Given** a user has configured a target directory (e.g., an Obsidian vault path) in the settings, **when** they are viewing a specific interaction, **then** an "Export to Knowledge Base" action is available.  
  2. **Given** this action is invoked, **when** the process completes, **then** a new, pre-formatted Markdown file containing the selected interaction (prompt, response, code) is created in the configured directory.  
* **Technical Implementation Notes:**  
  * The initial version of this feature will be implemented by directly writing formatted Markdown files to a user-configured directory. Care must be taken to handle file system permissions gracefully.  
  * A future plugin architecture would be designed to allow for more sophisticated integrations, potentially using URI schemes or local APIs exposed by the knowledge base tools themselves.  
* **Sub-tasks:** Design the settings UI for configuring the export path, implement a flexible Markdown export formatter, create the file-writing service with robust error handling.

## **4\. Requirements**

### **4.1. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The local proxy must add less than 50ms of latency to API calls. The UI must remain responsive even when displaying large sessions.  
* **Security:** All sensitive data (captured API traffic) must be encrypted at rest using AES-256. The application must not open any inbound network ports to the outside world.  
* **Reliability:** The application must handle graceful failures of the proxy or extension, providing clear error messages to the user.  
* **Usability:** The UI must be intuitive for a technical audience. All security-related features must be explained in clear, unambiguous language.

### **4.2. Testing Strategy**

* **Unit Testing (xUnit, Moq):** All business logic, services, and view models must have comprehensive unit tests. Goal: **\>90% code coverage**.  
* **Integration Testing:** Tests will cover the interaction between the desktop client, the proxy service, and the database. This includes testing the full data capture and storage pipeline.  
* **UI Testing (AvaloniaUI Test Automation):** Automated UI tests will be created for critical user workflows, such as the consent dialog, session locking, and generating a quality report.  
* **Coverage Reporting:** GitHub Actions will be configured to run all tests on every commit and generate a code coverage report (e.g., using Coverlet). Pull requests that decrease coverage below the threshold will be flagged.

### **4.3. Installation & Distribution**

* **Windows:** An MSIX package will be created for distribution via the **Microsoft Store** and for direct download. The installer must handle the trusted certificate installation seamlessly.  
* **macOS:** A notarized .dmg file will be provided for direct download. Submission to the **Mac App Store** will be investigated as a future goal, pending sandboxing requirements.  
* **Linux:** Distribute via .deb (for Debian/Ubuntu) and .rpm (for Fedora/CentOS) packages. These packages will be hosted in a dedicated apt and yum repository for easy installation and updates.
