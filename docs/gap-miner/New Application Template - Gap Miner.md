# **New Application**

## **App Title**

Gap-Miner

## **Development Plan**

This document provides a comprehensive development plan for the Gap-Miner application. The vision is to create a premier automated intelligence tool that identifies tangible market opportunities ("gaps") by systematically ingesting, analyzing, and contextualizing user feedback, complaints, and feature requests for existing software applications across various online platforms. The core goal is to empower developers, entrepreneurs, and product managers by transforming the noisy, chaotic world of online user feedback into a curated and actionable list of validated user needs. This will dramatically reduce the upfront risk and extensive manual research time typically associated with developing new products. It effectively answers the question: "What should I build next?" with data-driven confidence, moving product development from a place of intuition to a process grounded in evidence.

### **1\. Architectural Approach**

The system will be built using a modern, scalable, and resilient **service-oriented architecture**. This design is a strategic choice to ensure the long-term health and adaptability of the application. It decouples the core components, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling, which is crucial for a data-intensive application expected to grow in complexity and load. This approach promotes resilience; a failure in one component, such as a data ingestion worker, will not cascade and bring down the entire system.

* **Backend API Service:** A central API, built with FastAPI, will serve as the brain and primary interface of the application. It will be responsible for handling all user-facing operations, including user authentication and session management, managing data source configurations (e.g., adding or removing subreddits), and exposing the processed "gaps" via a secure, well-documented RESTful interface for the frontend to consume. Its asynchronous nature will ensure it remains responsive even under heavy load.  
* **Data Ingestion Workers:** A fleet of stateless worker services will be the workhorses of the system, responsible for all heavy, long-running data processing tasks. They will pull job definitions from the task queue, connect to external sources like the Reddit API to fetch raw data, perform the multi-stage NLP processing to identify, classify, and score potential gaps, and finally, persist the structured results into the main PostgreSQL database. Being stateless allows us to scale the number of workers up or down dynamically based on the queue depth, ensuring efficient resource utilization.  
* **Task Queue:** A high-performance message broker, using Redis, will act as the central nervous system for our asynchronous operations, decoupling the API from the workers. When a user adds a new data source, the API's only job is to place a message on the queue—a task that is nearly instantaneous. This prevents the API from blocking and ensures a snappy user experience. The queue provides durability, ensuring that even if all workers are down, the tasks are preserved and will be processed once the workers come back online.  
* **Frontend SPA:** A modern Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript will provide a rich, interactive user experience. It will communicate with the backend API to manage sources and display the mined data in a dynamic, filterable dashboard. The use of TypeScript will be critical for ensuring the frontend is robust and maintainable, as it allows for sharing type definitions with the backend API, reducing the likelihood of integration errors.

### **2\. Core Technologies**

| Category | Technology | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Backend Language** | Python 3.12+ | Chosen for its unparalleled ecosystem of mature data science and NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK, Transformers, scikit-learn), which are absolutely central to the core product functionality. Python's readability and vast community support accelerate development and simplify maintenance. |
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI | A modern, high-performance Python web framework ideal for building robust, asynchronous APIs. Its native support for Pydantic ensures automatic data validation, serialization, and generation of OpenAPI documentation, which significantly improves developer productivity and API reliability. |
| **Frontend Language** | TypeScript | Adds a strong static typing system to JavaScript. This is a critical choice for building a maintainable and scalable frontend application, as it allows developers to catch a large class of potential errors during development rather than in production, and makes code much easier to refactor. |
| **Frontend Framework** | React | A declarative, component-based library with a massive ecosystem and a huge talent pool. Its component model enables the rapid development of complex, reusable, and interactive user interfaces. The use of hooks provides a clean way to manage component state and logic. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | A powerful, open-source object-relational database renowned for its reliability, feature robustness, and strong support for complex queries. Its support for advanced data types like JSONB will be invaluable for storing semi-structured NLP metadata without sacrificing indexing and query performance. |
| **Task Queue** | Redis | An extremely fast in-memory data store that excels as a high-performance, low-latency message broker. It is perfect for managing the job queue between the API and workers, and its simplicity and reliability make it an ideal choice for this critical infrastructure component. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | The industry standard for containerizing applications. Using Docker ensures a consistent and reproducible environment across all stages—from a developer's local machine to staging and production servers. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem entirely. |
| **Orchestration** | Docker Compose | Used for defining and running the multi-container application locally with a single command. It dramatically simplifies the local development setup, allowing developers to get the entire stack (API, worker, database, queue) up and running in minutes. Kubernetes will be the target for production orchestration. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | A powerful and tightly integrated CI/CD platform that allows us to automate the entire build, test, and deployment pipeline directly from our source code repository. This ensures that every code change is automatically validated, improving code quality and enabling rapid, confident iteration. |

### **3\. Phased MVP Development Plan**

**Phase 1: Foundation & Backend Core**

* **Objective:** Set up the project infrastructure, define the data models, and build the core backend services required to manage data sources and dispatch processing jobs.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Initialize a monorepo on GitHub with distinct directories for api, worker, and frontend.  
  * Create a docker-compose.yml file to define and link the API, Worker, Postgres, and Redis services for a one-command local startup.  
  * Define the core database schema using SQLAlchemy's ORM, including tables for users, data\_sources, mined\_gaps, and job\_queue\_history.  
  * Build the core FastAPI application with endpoints for user authentication (JWT-based) and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data\_sources.  
  * Implement the Redis-based task queue logic within the API to dispatch ingestion jobs whenever a new data source is created or an existing one needs refreshing.

**Phase 2: Data Ingestion & NLP Worker**

* **Objective:** Create the autonomous worker service that can fetch raw text from external sources and perform the initial NLP analysis to identify potential market gaps.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Implement the main worker process that perpetually listens for new jobs on the Redis queue.  
  * Build the Reddit data connector, ensuring it respects Reddit's API rate limits and handles authentication securely.  
  * Develop the v1 NLP pipeline:  
    * **Text Cleaning:** Implement functions to remove HTML, URLs, and other noise from raw text.  
    * **Keyword/Entity Recognition:** Use spaCy to identify keywords, technologies, and product names.  
    * **Gap Classification:** Develop a rule-based or simple classifier model to identify sentences that express a problem, need, or feature request.  
  * Implement logic for storing the structured, processed results (the identified gap, source URL, relevant text, and metadata) back into the PostgreSQL database.

**Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard & API Integration**

* **Objective:** Build the user-facing web application that allows users to interact with the system and view the results of the data mining process.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Set up the React \+ TypeScript project using a standard toolchain like Vite.  
  * Build reusable UI components using Tailwind CSS for the main dashboard layout, data source configuration forms, and the cards used to display individual "gaps."  
  * Integrate the frontend with the FastAPI backend using Axios, implementing logic for login, fetching the list of gaps, and adding/deleting data sources.  
  * Implement client-side state management (e.g., using Zustand or React Context) to handle user authentication state and the fetched data.

**Phase 4: Alerts & Deployment Preparation**

* **Objective:** Add the final core MVP feature—user alerts—and harden the application for its initial production deployment.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Integrate a transactional email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and build a service class for sending templated emails.  
  * Create a scheduled task (e.g., a new type of job on the Redis queue) that checks for newly discovered, high-priority gaps and sends a summary email alert to the relevant user.  
  * Refine the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions to build and push production-ready, versioned Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).  
  * Create initial production deployment scripts (e.g., Kubernetes manifests or a simplified cloud deployment configuration).  
  * Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the full user workflow and perform initial performance tuning on database queries and the NLP pipeline.

## **Description**

### **Overview**

Gap-Miner is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application meticulously designed to automate and scale the arduous process of market research for software creators. It systematically monitors designated online platforms where users organically discuss software—starting with Reddit for the MVP—and applies a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to dissect these conversations. The system is tuned to identify and extract high-signal expressions of user needs, unsolved pain points, and explicit feature requests. These findings are then normalized, scored, and presented as qualified "market gaps" within a clean, actionable, and intuitive web-based dashboard. This transforms a qualitative, time-consuming task into a quantitative, data-driven process, allowing entrepreneurs, product managers, and indie developers to discover validated product ideas and feature enhancements without dedicating hundreds of hours to manual, often biased, research.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

**Scenario: User configures a new data source**

* **Given** I am a logged-in user on the "Sources" page of the dashboard  
* **When** I enter a valid subreddit name (e.g., "r/sysadmin") and click "Add Source"  
* **Then** I should see an immediate confirmation message, such as a toast notification, that the source was added successfully.  
* **And** a new job, containing the subreddit name and my user ID, should be placed on the Redis task queue for a worker to begin the initial mining process.

**Scenario: Worker processes a gap and it appears on the dashboard**

* **Given** a worker has been assigned an ingestion job for "r/sysadmin"  
* **When** the worker finds and successfully processes a comment expressing a clear need for a new tool  
* **And** it stores the structured result in the PostgreSQL database, linking it to the correct data source and user  
* **Then** the next time I load or refresh the main dashboard page, I should see a new card representing the identified "gap", containing the relevant text, a link to the original comment, and other metadata.

**Scenario: User enters an invalid data source**

* **Given** I am a logged-in user on the "Sources" page of the dashboard  
* **When** I enter a subreddit name that does not exist (e.g., "r/thissubredditdefinitelydoesnotexist") and click "Add Source"  
* **Then** the API should validate the source, find it invalid, and return an error.  
* **And** I should see a user-friendly error message on the screen, like "Could not find this subreddit. Please check the name and try again."  
* **And** no job should be placed on the Redis task queue.

## **Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Data Source Instability** | The application is highly dependent on external APIs (like Reddit's) which can introduce breaking changes, change their terms of service, tighten rate limits, or become temporarily unavailable. Any of these events would directly break our core data ingestion functionality. | We will abstract all data source logic behind a consistent internal interface (a "Connector"). This allows us to add new connectors or modify existing ones without changing the core worker logic. We will implement robust error handling, automated retries with exponential backoff, and configurable rate limiting. A key part of our monitoring will be to alert us immediately if API error rates spike, allowing us to respond quickly. |
| **Signal vs. Noise Ratio** | The primary algorithmic and business challenge is accurately identifying true, actionable "gaps" from the vast amount of irrelevant online chatter, sarcasm, and ambiguous language. A low signal-to-noise ratio would render the product useless. | We will start with a highly restrictive, precision-focused NLP filtering model and refine it iteratively based on real-world results. Crucially, we will build a user feedback mechanism directly into the dashboard ("this is a good gap" / "this is not a gap"). This feedback will not only improve the user's personal results but will also generate an invaluable, human-labeled training dataset for a future, more sophisticated Machine Learning classification model. |
| **Scalability** | As more users and data sources are added, the data processing volume will grow non-linearly, potentially creating bottlenecks in the database or overwhelming the workers. This could lead to slow processing times and a poor user experience. | The service-oriented architecture is specifically designed for this challenge. We can scale the stateless worker services and the database independently to meet demand. We will implement efficient database indexing from day one, use connection pooling, and design our NLP pipeline to be as memory-efficient as possible. For production, we will leverage auto-scaling groups for the workers based on the task queue's depth. |
| **Data Privacy & Ethics** | While we are handling publicly available user-generated content, this still carries significant ethical responsibilities. Inadvertently collecting or exposing sensitive information could damage user trust and create legal risks. | Our policy will be to only analyze publicly available data and to be fully transparent with our users about which sources we are monitoring. We will make no attempt to de-anonymize users. We will implement a multi-layer filtering system to detect and scrub potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like emails, phone numbers, and names from the text before it is stored in our database. |
| **Scraping Blockage (Future)** | If we expand to data sources that do not offer a formal API, we will need to rely on web scraping, which may expose us to anti-scraping technologies, IP blocks, and CAPTCHAs, making data collection unreliable. | This will be a last resort and will only be pursued for sources where it is ethically and legally permissiblee w proceed, weeb application accessible via a web browser. |
