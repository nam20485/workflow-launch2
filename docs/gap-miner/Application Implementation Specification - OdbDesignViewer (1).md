# **Application Implementation Specification**

## **1\. Application Title:**

ODB++ Web Viewer

## **2\. Application Synopsis:**

This document provides a comprehensive technical and architectural specification for the ODB++ Web Viewer, a web-based Single Page Application (SPA). The application is engineered to render interactive 2.5D and, subsequently, full true-to-scale 3D visualizations of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs. It is designed as a client for a pre-existing C++ backend service, OdbDesignServer, which parses ODB++ design archives and exposes the geometric and component data via a RESTful API.

The architecture is explicitly designed for a phased delivery to manage complexity and deliver value incrementally. The initial focus is on a 2.5D (extruded 2D) view, which provides immediate utility for layout verification, with a seamless and clearly defined upgrade path to a full 3D view. The core objective is to create a high-performance, interactive, and maintainable frontend client that delivers a fluid and intuitive user experience for engineers and designers to inspect and analyze PCB designs directly within a standard web browser, without the need for specialized desktop software.

## **4\. Target Platform Specification:**

* **Primary Compatibility:** Web (Single Page Application).  
* **Optimal Performance Environment:** Modern, evergreen desktop web browsers with robust WebGL 2.0 support. This includes the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge.  
* **Hardware Considerations:** The application will perform a feature detection check on startup. If a user's browser or hardware does not meet the minimum requirements for WebGL2, a clear, user-friendly message will be displayed explaining the issue, rather than allowing the application to fail or render incorrectly. While responsive, the UI is optimized for a desktop viewing experience due to the high-density information and detail-oriented nature of PCB design analysis.

## **5\. User Interface Framework:**

* **Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript.  
* **Rationale:** The selection of React is driven by its mature, high-performance, component-based architecture, which is exceptionally well-suited for building a complex and modular UI like a design viewer. Its virtual DOM ensures efficient updates, critical for a responsive user experience. TypeScript is mandated to add static typing, which is indispensable for reducing runtime errors and improving code quality, maintainability, and developer efficiency, particularly when handling the complex, nested JSON data structures from the ODB++ API.  
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework enables the rapid development of a clean, modern, and responsive user interface directly within the JSX. This approach promotes consistency, avoids large CSS files, and makes component styling self-contained and manageable.

## **6\. Architectural Pattern:**

The application will adhere to a modern frontend architectural pattern centered on unidirectional data flow and a strict separation of concerns to enhance predictability and debuggability.

* **Pattern:** Component-Based Architecture with Centralized State Management.  
* **Data Flow:** The user interface (the "View") is composed of discrete, reusable React components. User interactions (e.g., clicking a layer checkbox) trigger actions that update a central state store managed by **Zustand**. Components that depend on this state subscribe to the store and automatically re-render when the relevant data changes. This ensures a predictable and easily debuggable application state. All application logic for fetching and processing data is fully decoupled from the UI components and managed through a dedicated, abstracted API service layer.

## **7\. Core Application Logic and Architecture:**

### **7.1. Rendering Engine:**

The core of the application's visualization logic is encapsulated within the ViewerCanvas.tsx component. This component is solely responsible for managing the WebGL rendering context via the **Three.js** library. It initializes the scene, renderer, cameras, and lighting. Its primary function is to subscribe to the global design store and translate the JSON data into visible 3D objects (Meshes) in the scene. It also handles all user interactions within the canvas, such as mouse clicks for component selection, using raycasting.

### **7.2. Phased Rendering Strategy:**

The architecture is explicitly designed to support a two-phase implementation, allowing for a seamless upgrade path from a 2.5D MVP to a full 3D experience.

* **Phase 1 (2.5D View):**  
  * **Camera:** An OrthographicCamera is used to provide a flat, top-down projection without perspective, mimicking a traditional 2D CAD layout.  
  * **Geometry:** All PCB layers and components are rendered using 3D geometries (ExtrudeGeometry, BoxGeometry), but with a small, uniform, hard-coded extrusion height (e.g., 0.1 units) to create the "extruded" 2.5D effect.  
  * **Controls:** The OrbitControls are configured to disable rotation (enableRotate \= false), limiting the user to panning and zooming to reinforce the 2D experience.  
* **Phase 2 (Full 3D View):**  
  * **Backend Dependency:** This phase is contingent on the OdbDesignServer API being updated to include true Z-axis data (height for components, thickness for layers) in its JSON responses.  
  * **Camera:** A PerspectiveCamera is introduced to provide a realistic sense of depth and scale. A UI toggle will allow the user to switch between the Orthographic (Top View) and Perspective (3D View) cameras.  
  * **Geometry:** The geometry generation logic is updated to read the actual height and thickness properties from the API payload for each object, creating a true-to-scale 3D model.  
  * **Controls:** When in 3D mode, OrbitControls are reconfigured to enable full orbital rotation (enableRotate \= true).

### **7.3. State Management:**

Global application state (e.g., loaded design data, layer visibility flags, UI loading status, selected component ID) is managed in a central **Zustand** store. Zustand is chosen over more verbose options like Redux for its minimal boilerplate and simple, hook-based API, which integrates cleanly into React components. It provides an efficient, reactive "single source of truth" that makes the application's data flow predictable and easy to debug.

## **8\. AI/ML Model Specification:**

Not Applicable. This is a data visualization application and does not utilize any AI or Machine Learning models.

## **9\. AI/ML Integration Strategy:**

Not Applicable.

## **10\. Data Sources and Management:**

* **Primary Data Source:** The application's sole data source is the existing C++ **OdbDesignServer** RESTful API. The frontend is agnostic to the backend's internal logic and communicates exclusively through the defined REST API contract.  
* **Data Format:** All design data is fetched from the backend as JSON objects. A comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces will be defined to strictly model all expected API responses (e.g., Design, Layer, Component, Net), ensuring type safety throughout the application.  
* **Data Management:** All fetched design data and UI state are stored and managed within the central Zustand store. Communication with the API is handled by a dedicated, abstracted API service module (/services/api.ts) that uses the **Axios** library internally. This isolates all data-fetching logic from the UI components.

## **11\. Key Functional Features & User Stories:**

### **Epic: Core Viewer Functionality**

* **As a user, I want to upload an ODB++ archive (.tgz, .zip), so that the system can process it for viewing.**  
* **As a user, I want to see a 2.5D top-down view of the PCB, so that I can inspect the overall layout.**  
* **As a user, I want to pan and zoom the 2.5D view, so that I can navigate to specific areas of interest.**

### **Epic: MVP Interactivity**

* **As a user, I want to see a list of all PCB layers, so that I know what constitutes the design.**  
* **As a user, I want to toggle the visibility of individual layers, so that I can isolate and inspect specific parts of the board stackup.**  
* **As a user, I want to click on a component in the viewer, so that I can select it for further inspection.**  
* **As a user, I want to see the selected component highlighted in the viewer, so that I have clear visual feedback.**  
* **As a user, I want to see detailed properties (e.g., RefDes, Part Name, location) of the selected component in an information panel, so that I can understand its attributes.**

### **Epic: Full 3D Upgrade**

* **As a user, I want to switch from the 2.5D view to a true-to-scale 3D perspective view, so that I can understand the physical structure of the board.**  
* **As a user, I want to orbit, pan, and zoom the 3D model, so that I can inspect the board from any angle.**

## **12\. Security Architecture and Considerations:**

As a client-side application, security concerns are primarily focused on the interaction with the backend server and protecting the user's browser environment.

* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** The OdbDesignServer backend must be configured with a proper CORS policy to explicitly allow requests originating from the domain where the frontend application is hosted.  
* **Authentication (Future Scope):** While not in the initial scope, the architecture is prepared for future implementation of user authentication. The abstracted Axios API service can be easily configured with an interceptor to attach authorization tokens (e.g., JWT Bearer tokens) to all outgoing requests.  
* **Input Sanitization:** Though the application does not persist user-generated content, all data displayed from the API will be treated as potentially unsafe. React's inherent XSS protection will be relied upon to properly render this data in the DOM, preventing cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

## **13\. Deployment and Distribution Strategy:**

* **Build Process:** The React/TypeScript application will be transpiled and bundled into a set of optimized, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files using the **Vite** build tool.  
* **Hosting:** The resulting static assets are highly portable and can be hosted on any standard web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or a cloud-based object storage service with static website hosting capabilities (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).  
* **Containerization:** A production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfile will be created. This will define a container that first builds the React application in a Node.js environment and then serves the static output files using a lightweight, secure Nginx server. This simplifies deployment, ensures a consistent runtime environment, and is ideal for cloud-native deployment workflows. The application will be distributed to end-users via a URL.
