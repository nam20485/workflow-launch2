# **\[Application Name\]: Development Plan**

This document provides a comprehensive, multi-phase development plan for the \[Application Name\] application. It incorporates the architectural decisions made, outlines the core technologies, and defines user stories for key features.

## **1\. Motivation & Guiding Principles**

* **\[Provide a 1-2 paragraph summary of the project's "why." What is the core problem this application solves? Who is the target audience (e.g., developers, business analysts, consumers)? What is the unique value proposition compared to existing solutions? What does success look like for this project?\]**

The project is guided by these core principles, which will inform our decisions throughout the development lifecycle:

1. **\[Principle 1, e.g., Modularity\]:** \[Explain the principle and why it's important for this project. Example: The system must be composed of independent, loosely coupled components to enhance testability, maintainability, and long-term viability. This means adhering to patterns like SOLID and ensuring that a change in one part of the system (e.g., the database) has minimal impact on others (e.g., the UI).\]  
2. **\[Principle 2, e.g., Performance\]:** \[Explain the principle. Example: As a desktop application, the user experience must be fluid and responsive. This includes measurable goals like a sub-second application startup time, and ensuring that all I/O-bound or computationally intensive operations are handled asynchronously to keep the UI from freezing, providing constant feedback to the user.\]  
3. **\[Principle 3, e.g., User Experience\]:** \[Explain the principle. Example: The application must feel completely at home on the user's operating system. This involves adhering to platform conventions for look and feel, providing a clear and intuitive workflow, ensuring accessibility (WCAG compliance), and handling errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.\]

## **2\. Architectural Decisions**

* **\[Provide a 1-paragraph summary of the key architectural decision(s) made during the planning phase. State the chosen approach clearly and explain how it aligns with the guiding principles outlined above. For instance, "To achieve our goals of performance and native user experience, we have chosen to build the application using a native rendering engine..."\]**

We evaluated several options before arriving at our chosen architecture:

1. **\[Alternative Option 1\]:** \[Briefly describe the alternative. Explain why it was considered (its pros) and, more importantly, why it was rejected. Focus on the specific trade-offs. Example: "A WebView-based UI was considered for its styling flexibility but was rejected due to the high complexity of C\# to JavaScript interop, which would violate our principle of simplicity, and the potential for a non-native user experience."\]  
2. **\[Alternative Option 2\]:** \[Briefly describe another alternative and the reasons for its rejection. Example: "A microservices architecture was evaluated for its scalability but was deemed overly complex for the initial project scope, introducing significant deployment and operational overhead that would slow down initial development velocity."\]  
3. **\[Chosen Approach \- Stated Again\]:** This approach was selected for its **\[list 3-4 key benefits, e.g., optimal performance, simplicity, reliable data binding, and seamless user experience\]**. \[Acknowledge the known disadvantages of the chosen approach and explicitly state how they will be mitigated. Example: "While a native UI offers less styling flexibility than CSS, this will be mitigated by adopting the comprehensive Fluent UI design system, which provides a professional and consistent look and feel out-of-the-box."\]

## **3\. Core Technologies**

* **Language:** \[e.g., C\#, Python, TypeScript\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "C\# was chosen for its strong typing, performance, and mature ecosystem, making it ideal for building reliable and maintainable desktop applications."\]  
* **Framework:** \[e.g., .NET 9, ASP.NET Core, React\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., ".NET 9 provides the modern, high-performance, and cross-platform foundation for the entire application."\]  
* **UI Framework:** \[e.g., Avalonia, MAUI, React\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "Avalonia was selected for its true cross-platform capabilities, allowing a single C\# codebase to produce native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux."\]  
* **Default Theme:** \[e.g., Fluent UI, Material Design\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "The Fluent UI theme will be used to ensure a modern, clean aesthetic that feels native on Windows and looks professional on other platforms."\]  
* **Architectural Pattern:** \[e.g., MVVM, MVC, Microservices\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "The MVVM pattern will be strictly enforced to ensure a clean separation of concerns between the UI and the application logic, which is critical for testability."\]  
* **Key Libraries/Toolkits:** \[e.g., CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, Entity Framework Core\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "CommunityToolkit.Mvvm will be used to accelerate development by using source generators to reduce boilerplate code for observable properties and commands."\]  
* **Database:** \[e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "SQLite will be used for local data storage due to its serverless, zero-configuration nature and excellent performance for an embedded desktop application database."\]  
* **CI/CD:** \[e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps\]  
  * **Rationale:** \[Justify the choice. e.g., "GitHub Actions will be used to automate the build, testing, and release packaging process for all three target operating systems."\]

## **4\. Phased Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: \[Name of Phase, e.g., Foundation & Core Models\]**

* **Objective:** To establish the foundational project structure, define the core data models, and set up the development environment and CI/CD pipeline. This phase ensures all groundwork is laid before feature development begins.  
* **Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding**  
  * Initialize the Git repository with a standard .gitignore and README.md.  
  * Create the solution and project structure (.Core, .Services, .Desktop).  
  * Configure the basic CI pipeline in GitHub Actions to build and run unit tests on every push to the develop branch.  
* **Task 1.2: Design Core Data Schema**  
  * Define the primary C\# record types and entities that will represent the application's data.  
  * Implement the initial database context and migrations using Entity Framework Core.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A version-controlled solution that successfully builds and runs.  
  * An automated CI pipeline that passes.  
  * C\# record types for the core data model and a functional database schema.

### **Phase 2: \[Name of Phase, e.g., Backend Service Implementation\]**

* **Objective:** To implement the core business logic and services of the application, completely independent of the UI. All functionality should be verifiable through unit and integration tests.  
* **Task 2.1: Define Service Interfaces**  
  * Create C\# interfaces for all major services (e.g., IDataService, IFileParserService). This ensures the implementation is decoupled and can be easily mocked for testing.  
* **Task 2.2: Implement Business Logic**  
  * Write the concrete implementations of the service interfaces.  
  * Develop comprehensive unit tests for all services, covering success cases, edge cases, and error conditions.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A set of well-defined service interfaces.  
  * Fully implemented and unit-tested service classes.  
  * A high code coverage report for the services project.

### **Phase 3: \[Name of Phase, e.g., UI & Application Integration\]**

* **Objective:** To build the user-facing application, connect it to the backend services via dependency injection, and implement the main user workflows.  
* **Task 3.1: Implement Main ViewModel(s)**  
  * Create the ViewModels that will manage the application's state and logic.  
  * Inject the service interfaces into the ViewModel constructors.  
  * Implement commands and properties using the MVVM Toolkit.  
* **Task 3.2: Build the Main View(s)**  
  * Create the Avalonia XAML views.  
  * Declaratively bind the UI controls to the properties and commands in the ViewModels.  
  * Ensure the UI is responsive and provides feedback for long-running operations (e.g., loading indicators).  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A functional desktop application where users can interact with the core features.  
  * A clean separation between Views and ViewModels.

  I want \[to see a loading indicator for any operation that takes more than a second\],  
  So that \[I know the application is working and hasn't frozen\].

## **6\. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **\[Potential Risk, e.g., Performance Bottleneck\]** | \[Briefly explain the risk and where it might occur in the project. Example: "Processing very large input files on the UI thread could cause the application to freeze."\] | \[Describe the plan to prevent or handle this risk. e.g., "Implement asynchronous operations for all I/O-bound tasks; conduct regular performance profiling on key workflows; offload heavy processing to a background thread."\] |
| **\[Potential Risk, e.g., Third-Party API Changes\]** | \[Briefly explain the risk and its potential impact. Example: "The external data provider API we rely on could introduce breaking changes, causing our data import feature to fail."\] | \[Describe the mitigation plan. e.g., "Abstract the API client behind an interface; write a suite of integration tests against the live API that runs nightly to catch breaking changes early; have a clear error reporting mechanism."\] |
| **\[Potential Risk, e.g., Scope Creep\]** | \[Briefly explain the risk. Example: "Continuous addition of new features without re-evaluation could lead to missed deadlines and a bloated, unfocused application."\] | \[Describe the mitigation plan. e.g., "Adhere to a strict sprint planning process; all new feature requests must be documented, estimated, and prioritized for a future release, rather than being added to the current sprint."\] |
| **\[Potential Risk, e.g., Dependency Risk\]** | \[Briefly explain the risk. Example: "A key open-source library we depend on may become unmaintained or develop a critical security vulnerability."\] | \[Describe the mitigation plan. e.g., "Choose libraries with active communities and good track records; use a dependency scanning tool like Dependabot to be notified of vulnerabilities; abstract the library's functionality behind an interface to make it easier to replace if necessary."\] |
