# **User Story Epic Template**

## **Epic Title: \[A Clear, Feature-Oriented Title, e.g., "User Profile Management"\]**

### **1\. Epic Summary & Goal**

* **\[Provide a 1-2 paragraph narrative summary of the epic. What is the overall goal of this large feature? What problem does it solve for the user? This section should set the context for everyone on the team.\]**  
* **Core User Value Proposition:**  
  * **As a** \[Primary Persona, e.g., Registered User\],  
  * **I want** \[the overarching capability, e.g., to view and edit my profile information\],  
  * **So that** \[the primary benefit, e.g., I can keep my personal details up to date and control how I appear to others\].

### **2\. Personas Involved**

* **Primary Persona:** \[The main user type who will interact with this feature, e.g., "The End-User"\]  
  * **Description:** \[Briefly describe this user's goals and motivations in relation to this feature.\]  
* **Secondary Persona (if any):** \[Another user type who might be affected or have different permissions, e.g., "The Administrator"\]  
  * **Description:** \[Describe this user's role and how their interaction differs from the primary persona.\]

### **3\. User Stories (The "What")**

*This epic is broken down into the following individual, implementable user stories. Each story should be small enough to be completed within a single development sprint.*

* **Story 1: View Profile Information**  
  * **As a** Registered User,  
  * **I want** to navigate to a dedicated profile page,  
  * **So that** I can see my current account information, such as my username, email, and join date.  
* **Story 2: Edit Profile Fields**  
  * **As a** Registered User,  
  * **I want** an "Edit" button that makes my profile fields editable,  
  * **So that** I can update my personal information.  
* **Story 3: Save Changes**  
  * **As a** Registered User,  
  * **I want** to be able to save the changes I've made to my profile,  
  * **So that** my new information is persisted in the system.  
* **Story 4: Input Validation**  
  * **As a** Registered User,  
  * **I want** to see clear, inline error messages if I enter invalid information (e.g., a badly formatted email address),  
  * **So that** I can easily correct my mistakes before saving.  
* **\[Add more granular user stories as needed...\]**

### **4\. Acceptance Criteria (The "Proof of Done")**

*This is a testable, objective checklist that defines the conditions that must be met for this epic to be considered complete. The Gherkin (Given/When/Then) format is preferred for clarity.*

* **Scenario 1: Successfully Viewing the Profile**  
  * **Given** I am a logged-in user.  
  * **When** I click on my avatar or username in the navigation bar.  
  * **Then** I should be taken to the "/profile" page.  
  * **And** I should see my correct username and email address displayed as read-only text.  
* **Scenario 2: Successfully Editing and Saving a Field**  
  * **Given** I am on my profile page.  
  * **When** I click the "Edit" button.  
  * **And** I change the value in the "Username" textbox.  
  * **And** I click the "Save" button.  
  * **Then** I should see a success confirmation message (e.g., "Profile updated\!").  
  * **And** the page should return to its read-only state.  
  * **And** the new username should be displayed.  
* **Scenario 3: Attempting to Save Invalid Data**  
  * **Given** I am in "Edit" mode on my profile page.  
  * **When** I enter an invalid email address (e.g., "user@domain").  
  * **And** I click the "Save" button.  
  * **Then** the save operation should fail.  
  * **And** I should see a specific error message next to the email field, such as "Please enter a valid email address."  
  * **And** the form should remain in "Edit" mode.

### **5\. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

* **Performance:**  
  * The profile page must load in under \[e.g., 500ms\].  
  * Saving the profile information must complete in under \[e.g., 1 second\].  
* **Security:**  
  * A user must only be able to view and edit their own profile. Attempting to access another user's profile page via URL manipulation must result in a "Forbidden" (403) error.  
  * All user input must be properly sanitized on the backend to prevent XSS attacks.  
* **Usability:**  
  * The interface must be responsive and fully functional on screen widths down to \[e.g., 375px\].  
  * All interactive elements (buttons, text fields) must have clear focus indicators for accessibility.

### **6\. Out of Scope**

*To prevent scope creep, the following items are explicitly **not** part of this epic and will be addressed in a future epic:*

* Changing a user's password.  
* Uploading a profile picture.  
* Integrating with third-party social media accounts.  
* Administrator-level editing of user profiles.

### **7\. UI/UX Considerations**

* **Mockup/Wireframe:** \[Link to Figma, Sketch, or image file of the UI design\]  
* **Key Interactions:**  
  * The transition between the "view" and "edit" states should be smooth.  
  * Success and error messages should be displayed in a non-intrusive manner (e.g., toast notifications).
