# **New Application**

## **App Title**

MCP C++ SDK

## **Development Plan**

The project will be an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a comprehensive, cross-platform C++ SDK. The development will build upon the existing nam20485/mcpcpp project, populating the established CMake targets and project structure.

The core development will follow a phased approach:

1. **Core SDK Library Implementation (sdk/):** Develop the primary, high-level client API (McpClient) and the extensible tool provider framework (IToolProvider, ToolRegistry).  
2. **Server Logic & Testing (server/, tests/):** Implement the reference server logic (McpServiceImpl) and build a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests using Catch2 to ensure protocol correctness and system reliability.  
3. **Documentation & Examples (docs/, examples/):** Create detailed API documentation using Doxygen and write user-friendly guides and working example projects to ensure the SDK is easy to adopt and use.

## **Description**

### **Overview**

This project will produce a high-quality, open-source C++ Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The SDK is designed to be easy to use, even by non-experts, while providing a complete and performant implementation of the protocol. It will enable developers to easily build their own complex MCP-based applications, including clients, servers, and custom, pluggable tools.

The architecture is built on a modern C++20 toolchain, using gRPC for efficient, streaming communication and Google Protocol Buffers for robust, strongly-typed data serialization. A key design principle is extensibility, achieved through a well-defined tool provider interface that allows developers to add new functionality to an MCP server without modifying the core SDK. The project will be cross-platform, with a consistent build process across Windows, Linux, and macOS managed by CMake and vcpkg.

## **Requirements**

### **Features**

* \[x\] **Complete Protocol Implementation:** A 100% complete implementation of all MCP services, messages, and streaming behaviors.  
* \[x\] **High-Level Client API:** An intuitive McpClient class that abstracts away the complexities of gRPC and Protobuf.  
* \[x\] **Extensible Server Framework:** A server architecture based on a tool provider interface (IToolProvider) and a ToolRegistry for dynamic, pluggable functionality.  
* \[x\] **Cross-Platform Support:** Native compatibility and a unified build process for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
* \[x\] **Comprehensive Testing:** A full suite of unit and integration tests using the Catch2 framework to ensure correctness and reliability.  
* \[x\] **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  * Automated API reference documentation generated by Doxygen.  
  * Detailed, step-by-step usage guides and tutorials for common use cases.  
* \[x\] **Working Examples:** Complete, compilable example projects for a basic client and a server with a custom tool.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* The SDK and all associated examples must build successfully on Windows (MSVC), Linux (GCC), and macOS (Clang) using the provided CMake Presets.  
* The entire test suite must pass on all target platforms, achieving a high level of code coverage.  
* The generated Doxygen API documentation must be complete and published.  
* The example applications must run correctly and demonstrate the core functionality of the client and the server's tool provider framework.
