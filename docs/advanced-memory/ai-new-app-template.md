# New Application

## App Title

advanced-memory2 (dotnet)

## Development Plan

Implement mcp server-based advanced memory/recall/verificaiton/reasoning described in the two document links (below)

* Use the second option (python/neo4j)
* Except using ASP.NET Core instead in place of the python portion
* Use seperate ApiServices (or whatever logical method of separation makes sense) for each logical grouping of api endpoints
* Use the blazor webassembyl web app from the template project to provide a web interface that shows the progress and activity of the events happening in the services that make up the memory/recall/reasoning/verification
